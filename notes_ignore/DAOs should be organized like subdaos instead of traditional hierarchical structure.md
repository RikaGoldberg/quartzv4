I get Peter Pan's point. he is making an analogy to computer architecture. Personally, I think network theory is a better lens to look at social relationship and community building. Projects like coordinape and other dao tooling are doing this. I'm curious how they are looking at social networks and community and dao growth.

DAO Org architecture <> Microservices (SubDAOs)

In order to scale contribution towards DAOs, we need to move away from a monolithic organizational architecture where decisions are concentrated under a single bottleneck and instead operate as a set of ‘microservices’

Microservices are:

- Orientated around a single business function / bounded by contexts

- Run independently without dependencies, enabling the application to evolve within each service without needing to refactor  the entire system

k3nn.eth 
- sounds similar to holacracy, which is the model i believe most DAOs should be aiming for
