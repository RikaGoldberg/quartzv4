Every page needs to have metadata to improve the user experience: to find relevant information and discover resources. 
- DONE

Advocates of **manual memory management** believe it is superior to automated memory management, also known as garbage collection.

Ideas: 
- Garbage is different from trash. 
	- Trash is a GUI that is a temporary holding place for unwanted files set aside by the user, but not permanently erased. 
	- Garbage is parts of memory, including data, objects, or other system resources which will not be used in any future computation or by any program
		- Garbage needs to be deallocated to a heap, also known as a memory pool, **for reuse.** 
		- Data is used to create data visualizations
		**- Data as a concept refers to the fact that some information or knowledge is represented or coded in a form that is better for usage or processing.** 
			- Data processing usually happens in stages, with processed data from one stage considered raw data in another stage. 
			- **Data is informative to the extent that it is unexpected 
				- Shannon entropy is a good way to measure the unexpectedness of data
					- entropy being the measure of surprise or uncertainty in the possible outcomes
			- Data should only be used for decisionmaking after it is analyzed.** 
#fleetingnotes 
- Notes as a scaffolding for writing.
- Notes as a garbage dump
	- User - me, in this case, is the garbage collector aka garbage woman
- Notes as composting 
	- A useful analogy is the idea of garbage created by a software program. All software creates data. A process is needed to identify this. 
- Notetaking system as a computer memory system
	- A note system should be lean, but the notes themselves should be dense and rich.
	- Computer memory is finite and unused memory, or storage space, needs to be released 
	- A computer system must release unused resources, otherwise you have a memory leak: a type of bug. 
	- A computer's memory resources are scarce, in other words finite. 
	- A garbage system is necessary to remove unused files
	- Storage from the unused files then gets moved to the free-store for reuse
