[[DAOWei is a set of principles that guide members to act in a positive-sum way to achieve the DAOâ€™s mission.]]

[[content/content/self organization is superior to a top down hierarchical structure]] where you are told what to do by a manager or leader. 

System's theorist, [[content/content/donnella meadows]] has a lot to say about creating systems that are in alignment with the way of the living world. See [[content/content/Resilient systems need to be able to change themselves by creating whole new structures and behaviors]]

DAOs also need to be created in alignment with the way of the living world. They need to write clever rules for [[content/content/self-organization]] to "govern how, where, and what the system can add onto subtract from itself under what conditions." See [[Self-Organization-The power to add, change, or evolve system structure]]

#fleetingnotes 
DAOs need to mimic the structure of human genetic code, where out of only four different letters, an infinite number of combinations can arise, so that DAOs can continue to evolve as conditions change.  As Meadow's says, "for technology, the raw material is the body of understanding science has accumulated and stored in libraries and in the brains of ts practitioners. The source of variety is human creativity (whatever that is) and the selection mechanism can be whatever the market will reward, or whatever governments and foundations will fund, or whatever meets human needs. See [[Self-Organization-The power to add, change, or evolve system structure]]



Self-organization is superior to a hierarchical structure. Hierarchies are the default path for many companies because it is familiar and satisfies our human desire to control and exert power, but it is in contradiction to the way of nature. [[content/content/self organization is superior to a top down hierarchical structure]]

The idea here is that teams work best when they are self-organized. The best work is done when people are given autonomy.  

DAOs follow principles of self-organization, wherein structure, aka best practices, processes, and scaffolding, emerges organically, without a hierarchy. The intent is to be leaderless, meaning to not have any one person rise up from the swarm of team members. A byproduct of self-organization is that team members get work done how they see best without a manager, without deadlines, without an approvals hierarchy. 

In MetaFactory, the approvals hierarchy is the curation game. Managers don't approve, instead community members have skin in the game and make decisions. 

Working groups are how MetaFactory organizes, so they can get work done more effectively and efficiently.

DAOs emerge through loose structure. This is not new. We can look to humans or other living organisms, like plants, animals, and natural resources, as examples of emerging systems. 

Big tech companies like Google have mimicked self-organization in the way they structure teams. Google has written about the superiority of self-organization in [[content/content/Google Published Patterns site on the immense value of self-organized Teams]]
