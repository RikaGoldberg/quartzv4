[[quartz/notes_ignore/Metafactory wants to attract hypebeast brands by exposing them to new audiences]]

It has become more apparent that MetaFactory is using marketing tactics, like scarcity and auction expirations, to create hype in its products, just like streetwear brands do. But they also want to be around for the long term so speculation isn't their only MO. They want to make money but also build for the future.

Hammad said this on the podcast. Crypto is a good use case for scarcity. My gut reaction is this is bad because scarcity is bad  (it creates conflict and rivalries) and abundance is good. 

I want to believe that crypto also builds in abundance. We have a scarce asset, right, but people aren't fighting over NFTs. People aren't fighting over shoes. But NFTs are getting exorbitantly marked upbecause they're limited and scarce and people have perfected the art of the drop. But MF says they're different because the NFT IS the product.
