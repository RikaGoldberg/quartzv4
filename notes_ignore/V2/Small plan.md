Saturday April 9

I want to have a slightly productive session today at Cafenated, so I need to make a small plan. Lightweight. 

My audience for newsletter could be white men who are burnt out and don't know it. Why? Because these are future fathers and we need to take care of them. 

Harry supported me with crypto. Now that I'm here, I can pay him back a little, even if he doesn't know it...yet...

Who do I know who writes about burn out?
- Haider
- Steph Smith
- Every? 
- Zen Habits
- Marginalian

What famous authors stories do I know about how they found their wei? 

My thinking needs to become dialectic, where I deeply understand flaws in current system and work with current players, rather than as Donella says, find ones who I play with.  

Writing is different than other activities, where you allocate X amount of time and then go and do X task. 

* If I had lunch with Andy Matuschak, what would I ask him? 

How much time do you spend outside each day? Why? 

Do you have goals? How do you think about goals?

Do you have a long term vision? What is your long term vision?

What drives you? How do you act on your ambition? 

Why is writing important? 
god damn, these girls are so annoying. caddy. so what? it reminds me of the old me. So what? it's embarrasing. 

I succeeded in creating a digital garden. 

This time, 2 years ago, I was  confused about my life. Now, I feel like i'm around people who just like me for me and who think i am good enough, except harry. he sucks. 

One surprise of crowdfunding research has been the pleasure of building a closer relationship with a community of people enthusiastic about my ideas. But to do good work, I mostly need to avoid thinking about funding and funders.
