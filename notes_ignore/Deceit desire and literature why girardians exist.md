#summary 

Landy is trying to get to the root of [[desire]]: why do people do the things they do. Girard, who Landy disagrees with, thinks people desires stem from wanting to be like someone else. Landy thinks some [[desire]] is intuitive and we want things because they are useful. 

Similar to what opensea writes in the NFT bible, people [[desire]] NFTs because they are useful like you get special privileges in a world, you get access to a world, or special abilities in a game. 

 Landy heeds that when you desire something that someone else also wants, and that item is scarce, it creates rivalry. 

#fleetingnotes 
**Landy believes that when people want the same thing but there's not enough of it, aka the desired item is scarce, rivalry is created.** 

**Landy shits on Girard's mimetic [[desire]] which makes the assumption that people's desires arise by seeing others doing something vs. innate desire that comes from within.** This creates conflict between people who are trying to get the same thing.

He provides the example of oil. **People want oil because it is a valuable and useful resource, not necessarily because someone else, aka another country, has it. A desire to have what someone else has does not explain all of our desires.** 

But surely it explains some of our desires. In lore, keeping up with the Joneses' has been for a long time part of our vernacular. **Sometimes people do want something simply because someone else has it.** 

Landy thinks Girard's theory is too much of a blanket statement: *all* violence is the result of people competing for the same thing. *Some* violence, Landy argues, is, but not *all*. Thomas Hobbs made this clear years before Girard. 

Landy says that Girardianism says human beings have no desires of their own, thus there is no such thing as autonomy or free will. **We do things simply because others are doing them.** 

#quotes 
The scenario above is of course absurd. **Not only is it ludicrous to imagine that Joey couldn’t have had his own, autonomous hankering to take a dip (we’ll come to that in a moment); it’s also ludicrous to imagine that anyone in their right mind would start a fight in these circumstances.** (Beaches are simply littered with people not fighting with each other.) But why not? Isn’t it true that “as soon as we desire something that is desired by a model sufficiently close to us in space and time . . . we strive to snatch the object away from him”? No, of course it isn’t. Jimmy and Joey are standing right next to each other, yet Joey has no desire whatsoever to deprive Jimmy of his opportunity to swim. And the reason is simple: _there’s plenty of lake to go around_. **Mimetic desire is not enough to cause rivalry; in order to have rivalry, you also need scarcity of resources**

**Mimetic desire, then, is not sufficient to cause rivalry.** More than that, it’s not even _necessary_. Consider the case of oil. **Many assume, with some justification, that the main cause of the 1990–91 Gulf War had much to do with access to oilfields**. S**hall we say that the United States and its allies took an interest in those oilfields—to the point of being willing to kill and die for them—only because the Iraqis had taken an interest in them first? Or should we rather say that people like oil, because (for good or ill) it helps them stay warm, make stuff, and get around?**20( https://arcade.stanford.edu/rofl/deceit-desire-and-literature-professor-why-girardians-exist#_ftn20) One could multiply the examples endlessly; the world is full of conflicts, large and small, that have nothing to do with mimetic desire.

**Of course some desire is mimetic. And of course some mimetic desire leads to rivalry, and of course some rivalry leads to violence. But not all violence derives from this, and indeed probably not very much violence derives from this.** All you need is a desire—not mimetic desire, any desire—plus scarcity of resources. (Under conditions of scarcity, even a physical need will do.) **That’s why Thomas Hobbes’s theory is, and has always been, far more helpful than Girard’s. “If any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies,” said Hobbes,[21] long before Girard was born, in a book that most serious thinkers have read, and without any need for fanciful metaphysical speculation.**

Let’s sum up: it is perfectly possible to form desires in the absence of a model (the pica sufferer’s yearning for dirt); it is perfectly possible, conversely, for others’ desires to leave us cold (the child’s stubborn disinclination toward brussels sprouts); the fact that we sometimes act on recommendations from admired friends and experts proves nothing, since we are entirely capable of ignoring them (_Kill Bill 2_, no thank you);33(https://arcade.stanford.edu/rofl/deceit-desire-and-literature-professor-why-girardians-exist#_ftn33) and the fact that there are always multiple potential models (brother Aron, brother David) strongly suggests that those potential models are not doing the choosing for us. **In short, there is no basis at all to the central premise of Girardianism: that “human beings have no desires of their own,” that there is never a reason (objective or subjective) for wanting something rather than something else, that spontaneous impulses are an illusion, that autonomy is impossible.**
