#summary 
The [[content/content/DAOWei]] is 6 principles for how to be an effective DAO contributor. I made up the DAO Wei, as, of course, all frameworks are made up. I was deeply inspired by [[content/content/donnella meadows]] and her use of nature to teach about systems. She teaches that a system's structure - the relationships between elements and the incentives for value transfer - is paramount to building resilient and adaptable systems. 

I. Introduction: DAO Wei
		Q. [[content/content/Changing paradigms requires pointing out anomalies and failures and working with active change agents]]
	A. [[DAOWei is a set of principles that guide members to act in a positive-sum way to achieve the DAOâ€™s mission.]]
	B. [[content/content/An effective DAO contributor needs to understand the DAO wei to one day, maybe, start their own sub dao]]
		B1. Note: these principles are not static, they are evolving, and they are [[content/content/Embrace good enough structures and processes|"just good enough"]]
	C. I'm using Metafactory as a case study to help you learn because Metafactory is extremely successful and you can learn a lot from them, many lessons and insights - just like I have.
	C. Lighthearted member tweets about what DAOWei is, true MetaCartel style, before we dive into DAOWei. (excellent feature by the way, advanced search in twitter.)
		a. Tweets [[content/content/Yalor Moon]]
II. [[content/content/Principle 1 Start with the assumption that you don't know the wei]]
		Q. [[content/content/Before you disturb a system in any way, watch how it behaves]]
	a. Let's watch how nature behaves 
		[[content/content/DAOs should be designed in alignment with the way of nature]]
			 b2a Nature creates [[content/content/self-organization|self-organized]] [[content/content/resilience|resilient]] systems that can [[content/content/Resilient systems need to be able to change themselves by creating whole new structures and behaviors|change themselves by creating whole new structures and behaviors]] by way of [[content/content/emergence]]
			 b2b [[content/content/self organization is superior to a top down hierarchical structure]]
				 [swarming]] behavior in ant leaderless ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders, but rather each ant reacts to stimuli. This creates emergence where the ants can do something, together, that alone they couldn't do, or with direct orders they couldn't do.
			b2c [[content/content/DAOs should be organized like subdaos instead of traditional hierarchical structure]]
			b2d ants, like daos, need to organize themselves into circles aka groups aka sub daos to become a superorganism. in the dao world, we use carl jung's term of the collective consciousness.
			b2c [[content/content/Self-organizing teams require mature and disciplined behavior]]
			b2d teaser here about [[content/content/DAOs should be organized like subdaos instead of traditional hierarchical structure]] but full explanation in Principal 5 dancing with the system, letting go, and joining a working group which is a sub dao
A. MF is really successful, just look at the metrics. For someone who has worked in business, created products, launched ecommerce platforms, it's tempting to start offering unsolicited feedback, or picking up on potential pain points and providing solutions, too fast, offering your skills, too fast. 
	 a. Funny example about being too enthusiastic because you'll end up assuming and it may be wrong and you'll create problems.
III. [[Principle 2 Become a student of the wei]]
	Q. Adler distinguishes between striving for power and striving for mastery and overcoming obstacles.  pg. 58 
	a. Pretend you're back in school and learn
	b. Yes, this means even the boring stuff because it sets the foundation. 
		i. [[content/content/decentralized brand]] all of the key terms
		ii. [[content/content/brand economy]]
		iii. [[content/content/brand community]]
IV. [[Principle 3 Remix your wei]] 
	Q. Cognitive exploration quote pg. 104
	a. Pay attention to what makes you curious, what calls you in.  
	b. Drew and Hammad's origin story and swag DAO as inspiration
		[[content/content/Metafactory wants to transform crypto culture through fashion]]
	c. Maybe it's FOMO3D-like game mechanics/gambling/auction/cryptoeconomic mechanism design/art/fashion/future of work
V. [[Principle 4 Laugh all the wei]]
	Q. [[A cynic is a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing]]
	A. Example of a cynic's response to MF
	B. Funny devil wears prada metaphor
	C. Laugh at Prada's current ownership structure 
VI. [[Principle 5 Dance with the system]]
	Q. Mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go, and dancing with the system. 
	A. Now that you have studied a DAO, you can finally plug yourself in. But only, now, after you've studied it. 
	B. join a working group in MF
		b1. working groups follow the system's principle of self-organization
VII. [[content/content/Principle 6 Symmetry is the wei]]
