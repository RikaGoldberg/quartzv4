**Self-organized teams in Metafactory**

We can think of Metafactory DAO members like worker ants. 

DAO members need to effectively organize so they can work together to accomplish great feats. And DAOs need to be around for a long time, requiring an organizational structure that is designed to be resilient to stress and adaptable to change. 

Monolithic organizational structures, with hierarchies and bosses, that scale up horizontally,  don’t work in the new world of DAOs. 

The needle moves slowly in monolithic structures, hindering innovation, and frustrating workers at all levels of the hierarchy. 

We need a new organizational structure that is nested, like circles, or a web - and is more harmonious with the wei of nature.

Metafactory is experimenting with a structure like this: [sub DAOs](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1502020212136185857). 

Metafactory members self-organize into working groups, small independent teams with their own objectives. [iRobot DAO](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/irobot-season-2/287) is one of these sub DAOs. Nested under Metafactory, iRobot is its own unique DAO, focusing on all things ROBOT (Metafactory’s native token) like governance, liquidity, distribution, and analysis. 

Metafactory is also focused on building [microfactories](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/metafactory-4-20-ted-talk/255), or small production facilities that operate like sub DAOs. [One microfactory](https://twitter.com/TheMetaFactory/status/1465825289599008769?s=20&t=UxN6tpN-5dPJE5KScBGY8Q) is already up and running in Berlin.


**MetaFactory’s mission is to become a decentralized brand.** 

What is a decentralized brand? 

Surprisingly, there is no page for ‘decentralized brand' on Wikipedia.

The term is brand new.  

So let’s build it up from its foundation, using a reductionist approach to define each of the words, separately, and then put them  back together to form a holistic definition of a decentralized brand.

Define brand:

According to Wikipedia, “a brand is a name, term, design, or symbol, that distinguishes one seller’s goods or services from those of other sellers.”

Define decentralized: 

According to Wikipedia, decentralization is “the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.”

Put the two terms together: a decentralized brand is a unique name, term, design, or symbol that is neither planned by a central authoritative group, nor are decisions made by a central authoritative group.

This is a good start. 

Why is a brand valuable?

Look at the history.

According to Wikipedia, the practice of branding has roots that go all the way back to the Egyptians in 2,700 BCE. 
 
“The practice of branding - in the original literal sense of marking by burning - is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.”

Why are people today paying a lot of money for a brand?

High fashion aficionados are willing to pay upwards of ten thousand dollars for a Birkin bag. The value of the bag goes up over time, so it’s not only an accessory, but also an investment. 

Gen Z, Gen X, and Gen Alpha are willing to shell out thousands of dollars for limited edition streetwear like t-shirts and sneakers. 

As Metafactory writes, people are eager to spend bookoo money on brands primarily to show that they are part of a subculture. Birkin bags are not available on demand at stores. If you want to buy a Birkin bag, you need to know how. And legit streetwear brands aren’t just available at the store, either. You need to know how to acquire them, via a drop on a website, a physical store, or a resale platform. 

People who are willing to pay the money also have an eye for quality. As Avery Booker, the CEO of Enflux, a data-tech company that helps companies predict trends and consumer behavior, says about the drop culture: 

“The younger customer is already well tuned into it. They have a unique eye, they know what they can resell, and they know many brands. I think they are very discerning customers in a way, which is fascinating.”

Brands are extremely valuable in society. Their value can be traced back to the Egyptians in 2,700 BCE. Brands are not only fashion statements, but also investments, and entrypoints to a subculture.

My research took me to two more key terms: brand community and brand economy. 

Brand community is, according to Dialogue (a company that helps brands craft their strategy) is a group of like-minded people who form an attachment to a brand or product.

Brand economy, which we have not yet touched on, is according to me (a person who has interacted with brand economies) a marketplace where a brand’s assets can be bought and sold. 

Finally, with all of the key terms defined, and answers to a few “why” questions, I have a definition for decentralized brand (remember, Metafactory’s mission is to become a decentralized brand): 

A decentralized brand is an apparel marketplace that sells dope products deeply valued by a community of loyal followers. The community makes decisions about which products are sold and the direction of the marketplace, without managerial oversight or a central approval authority.

Metafactory is already making moves to decentralize with an initiative called The Curation Game. 

The Curation Game will give members decision making power over which designs go into production. Members will act like curators, staking Robot on the designs they want to see produced, and then get rewarded based on a proportional amount of the design’s sales. 

            

**Metafactory’s origin story**

Metafactory started out as Swag DAO, an idea that Drew had during Devcon, an Ethereum conference, in Osaka, Japan. SwagDAO was the first attempt at transforming crypto culture with fashion.

TLDR; Drew wanted to spice up swag that companies gave away at crypto conferences. He envisioned an auction system where two t-shirt designs would be auctioned at the same time, but only one design would win. Bidders who bid on the winning design, only pay Cost of Goods Sold, subsidizing the losing bidders who must pay full price, MSRP, for the shirts. The auction would be live for 30 days, with the swag price dropping over time in line with a continuous token bonding curve (note: [a continuous token bonding curve](https://medium.com/coinmonks/token-bonding-curves-explained-7a9332198e0e) is a smart contract that creates its own market for tokens without relying on exchanges). 

I know this sounds complicated, and it is, but if anyone could pull it off, it’s definitely Drew. 

Why?

Because Drew was a student of the wei. 

As a founding member of MetaCartel, he carefully observed emerging governance structures and community approaches, figuring out how to best use his skills to build something that people needed.

Drew also has an insatiable curiosity to design systems, using crypto as a backdrop for experimenting with game theory.

And, he had a ton of experience, more than a decade, actually, building legacy mobile and web development products. [He ran two successful digital agencies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewharding/details/experience/). 

Of course, Drew could not build Swag DAO alone. He would need a lot of support, so to find ‘the others’, he designed a [branding competition](https://medium.com/metacartel/swagdao-design-competition-3848ba2750de) and this meme:

Drew was looking for people who were curious about game theory and cryptoeconomics, knew a thing or two about apparel and marketing, and had good design skills.

The winner of the competition was Hammad Jutt a.k.a. MetaDreamer. 

Hammad studied Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, mined bitcoin in the early days, built successful Internet businesses [for a fashion audience](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/nelo-university-alberta-fashion-hollywood-1.4474028), and was researching game theory and cryptoeconomics.

Hammad’s submission was clever and fun. He also proposed changing the brand name from Swag DAO to Metafactory.

Note how the first image looks like a page from a coloring book, foreshadowing an idea that Metafactory would turn into reality by producing a c_hoose your own adventure_ sweatshirt [ready to decorate with markers](https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/choose-your-own-adventure-sweatshirt-bundle).
