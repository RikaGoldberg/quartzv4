#quotes 
* The stench of war once again fills the air. At times like this, I’ve learned that recycling the news and generating more noise is worse than useless.

* It reveals the emergent nature of pure evil and is hands-down the most terrifying thing I’ve read in my life.

* At the economic level, Moloch is not a simplistic criticism of capitalism, it’s a criticism of simplistic capitalism. The evidence our system has descended into Moloch territory is the explosion in winner-takes-all outcomes coupled with a significant increase in financial shocks and crises. According to IMD, the average lifespan of an S&P 500 company has dropped precipitously from 61 years in 1958 to 18 years today.

* At the company level, myopic focus on short-term earnings has often had devastating effects. In the book Lights Out, authors Gryta and Mann talk about how General Electric’s culture of “making the numbers at all costs” gave rise to “success theater” and “chasing earnings.” This contributed to what Bill Gates has called “one of the greatest downfalls in business history.”

* Within our currently-dominant business models, a focus primarily on engagement algorithms has led to social media that amplifies negativity and polarization

* Within individuals, narrow pursuit of abstract Moloch leads to the same fate as King Midas. We wish anything we touch would be turned to gold, and everything we love also becomes inanimate and lifeless as a consequence. Moloch is the god of child sacrifice because his promise is simple: throw that which is most valuable on the flames and I will grant you power. How many of us surrender our whole lives to abstract things that don’t bring us any joy?

* It’s also commonly the story of how one person chasing power, driven by fear and scarcity, is willing to throw the whole world into the fire

* As a result, we are being faced with a global reassessment of priorities

* Some interesting trends have already flooded in to fill the open space. Creative projects and small business formation have exploded. A recession may temporarily reverse these trends, but not the reawakening of a mindset. It is also driving a reappraisal of business models that incorporate more resilience

* I have been fortunate to come to know William Oliver, co-founder of In Practice. Through an incredibly robust series of thousands of interviews with experienced business managers, William and his co-founder have been building toward a library of what they views as “quality” companies. In many of our conversations, we have been struck by how few quality companies there are now in public markets; all perceived inefficiencies get competed away or targeted by short-term activists and management consultants. The private markets can sometimes provide a small defense, as can an aligned shareholder base. There are two resonant examples.

* Four people I deeply trust have all independently told me to read Becoming Trader Joe. Brandon Beylo recently did a great summary (below). There are many insights that reinforce the paradigm shift we are watching unfold in American business and culture. Trader Joe’s regarded vendors not as competitors but almost as their own employees. A healthy ecosystem benefits everyone. Likewise, their own employees were paid well above market, especially their buyer

* The U.S. Marines have a heuristic for when things go awry: “keep moving, seek the high ground, stay in touch.” A response to chaos requires dynamism, perspective, and relevant external information. No static plan survives contact with the enemy. The critical skillset in that situation is expert intuition gained from experience: see the world clearly and act decisively.

* Thus you’d anticipate that elite managers also have an intuitive sense for balance and rapid reaction. And this is exactly consistent with Lia DiBello’s compelling argument that “superstar” businesspeople all share the same mental model of business (see Cedric Chin’s article below). She believes expert businesspeople can intuitively and dynamically balance the three key pillars of supply, demand, and capital.  “Unlike most business professionals, they are attuned to the early indicators of widespread change. Beyond this, they are expert at keeping the triad in balance, or shifting the balance when external conditions are conducive to do so.

* This further reinforces a simple yet overwhelming conclusion across every source I’ve found. The key to flourishing is prioritizing and balancing dynamic, ever-changing external information over static internal models.

* Flowing life beats stale Moloch.

* Perhaps most damningly, focus on abstract ideas and intellectual concepts has distracted many leaders from real-world constraints. As George Orwell wrote, “sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.”

* When thinking about how to build the mindset of a superstar businessperson, there’s an awkward but inevitable conclusion. Any formal training system or strategy risks becoming an abstract target, and we’re right back at Moloch. The key point, one that I think seems intuitively true to all of us, is that real-life experience tends to trump mental models. But this doesn’t mean the acquisition of experience can’t be accelerated. How do we dial-up the influence of external life on our internal processes? Cedric’s article below has a fascinating, deep examination of how you optimize for the acquisition of expert intuition.

* “The idea that there is information in your life, if you are looking for transformation, but you have to teach yourself to attune to it. And so, what do you need to attune to in transformational processes? Things that make you feel expansive, things that make you feel alive, letting go of your rational idea of what you should do and noticing what you move towards. Noticing what you’re curious about, noticing the people who energize you, the activities that make you feel more alive.

* ….A big insight was that where your attention goes, your life goes, and if you are constantly putting your attention on living things, this more aliveness in your own life.”
