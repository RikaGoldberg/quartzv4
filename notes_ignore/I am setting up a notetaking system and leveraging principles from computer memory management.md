Description: 

I am setting up a personal mini wiki and leveraging principles from [[content/content/computer memory management]] to set up my note-taking system. Like computers, the human [[content/content/brain]] also builds up garbage that needs to be recycled, because memory space is finite, not infinite.

Some people are worried about using machine analogies to describe how the human [[content/content/brain]] works. [[Sherry Turkle]] is one of those people. I listened to her on Sean Carroll's podcast Mindscape.
