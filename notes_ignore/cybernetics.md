Cybernetics is a wide-ranging field concerned with regulatory and purposive systems. **The core concept of cybernetics is circular causality or feedbackâ€”where the observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways that support the pursuit and maintenance of particular conditions, or their disruption.** Cybernetics is named after an example of circular causality, that of steering a ship, a) where the helmsperson maintains a steady course in a changing environment by adjusting their steering in continual response to the effect it is observed as having. Other examples of circular causal feedback include: **technological devices such as thermostats (where the action of a heater responds to measured changes in temperature, regulating the temperature of the room within a set range)**; biological examples such as the coordination of volitional movement through the nervous system; a**nd processes of social interaction such as conversation**. Cybernetics is concerned with feedback processes such as steering however they are embodied, including in ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and social systems, and in the context of practical activities such as designing, learning, managing, conversation, and the practice of cybernetics itself. Cybernetics' transdisciplinary and "antidisciplinary" character has meant that it intersects with a number of other fields, leading to it having both wide influence and diverse interpretations.
