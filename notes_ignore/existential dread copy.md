Existential angst, sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish, is a term common to many existentialist thinkers. **It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility.** The archetypal example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that "nothing is holding me back", **one senses the lack of anything** that predetermines one **to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom.**

I. With great freedom, comes great responsibility. -->This is a cliche. But as Donnella points out, there can be a lot of truth/wisdom in cliches. 
	IA. The responsibility is dealing with dread. Anxiety?
		1a. Responsibility means facing choice, meaning freedom. 
		1b. Jumping off a cliff, or not, is the archetypal example of facing freedom.
