#fleetingnotes 
When I formed a positive opinion about DAOs, a.k.a, red-pilling (from the Matrix movie), I felt a strong impulse to persuade others of my opinion. Acting on the impulse, I emphatically shared my passion with friends, family, and Internet strangers, but I did not receive the response I wanted. Some people were more curious than others, or just more polite, but no one took my opinion as seriously as I would have liked. As far as I know, no one quit their job, no one asked me to send them more information, and no one joined a DAO. 

At first, I was frustrated and disappointed, but upon further reflection, I realized that this is just the way that it is. In today’s world of information abundance, it’s increasingly more challenging to find the signal amidst the noise. As philosopher Byung-Chul Han writes in his book,

[[content/content/In the swarm]]
	“Knowledge does not simply lie at the ready. One cannot just find it there, as one can find information.”

Given what I now know about information burn-out, from my readings as well as from personal lived experience, I no longer try to persuade others about DAOs. I do continue to spread positive messages, but I no longer persuade. It’s simply too exhausting - for minimal, if any, reward. 

Instead, I write for the red-pilled. I write for the folks who are crypto and DAO literate; the ones who see the potential of this new technology, but, like all of us, myself included, need more guidance and new perspective for sensemaking. 

If this sounds like you…excellent! I welcome you to hop on board as we explore MetaFactory and iRobot DAO, together. I promise you that this short story will be a fun ride.

MetaFactory DAO is a unique, quirky, snowflake, that is blending the digi-physical worlds. Drew Harding and Hammad Jutt, come from the Snow Crash camp, so if you’re into imagining digital worlds with avatars that leverage AI/VR, you will love learning about MetaFactory. And if you’re not into avatars, perhaps a future digital world scares you - I know it scares me - don’t worry because MetaFactory is also working on amazing innovations in the physical world. 

What I’m trying to say is that there is a little bit for everyone in this short story. And if you are a writer, or are interested in becoming a writer, I hope this short story, or other stories in the series, inspires you to find your own words to share. Remember, we are playing positive sum games in crypto, so there is plenty of space and opportunity for you to shine. 

A few ideas stood out to me when I first read Peter’s quote. The first idea is that  MetaCartel, first and foremost, is an organization for the technically savvy, for the folks who grew up with computers and the Internet, and these devices have become like another appendage. 

[[Hammad Jutt]], MetaFactory’s co-founder, embodies my “computer as an appendage” theory. In junior high, Hammad used spare computer parts, lying around the house, to build computers that he would sell for extra cash. Hammad, also an avid gamer, learned about bitcoin on Runescape forums (Runescape is a MMO RPG game released in 2001). At the time, he wasn’t thinking about the deeper implications of bitcoin - he just thought bitcoin was a cool way to make money (especially for a junior high-schooler!)

  The second idea that stood out is the metaphor of MetaCartel as a nation. If you remember from the first short story, [[content/content/MetaCartel, in addition to its role as an altruistic grants-giving DAO, also serves as an incubator for new DAOs]]
  
  - a  warm and friendly place where ideas and people collide. Another way to look at MetaCartel -  as Peter eloquently described, is like a nation. DAOs that are created in MetaCartel become natural-born citizens. They become part of the MetaFamily.]]

**Dancing with the system**

Before judging a DAO, make sure that you study it because, chances are, the properties that may seem weird, or even wrong, are on purpose - created in the spirit of experimentation and emergence. 

There are a lot of weird things about MetaFactory, but if you want to be a part of the movement, you have to learn to let go and just dance. 

I’m going to just dive right in and list out the weirdness, from least weird to most weird. There are probably additional weirdnesses. It’s probably like a weirdness onion, actually, where you peel back the weird, one layer at a time, so let’s start with the outside surface, and slowly peel back the layers, outside in. 

Weirdness of MetaFactory: 

**- Self-organization 
	- This is the least weird because successful technology companies, like Google, are constantly striving to self-organize teams**
		- Why is this weird for DAOs? 
			- Maybe because DAOs are silly structures. Or because it's less apparent with Google since they are closed, and not everyone can contribute, but if you talk to someone who works at Google they will tell you that it's very self-organized. Or maybe because they're a traditional company, or they're already successful. Idk!
		- Regardless, we know self-organization is good, and it's important DAOs do it in the right way. What is the right way? 
			- **Note that self-organization requires maturity and discipline. Some people are uncomfortable with self-organization. Stakeholders such as the Product Owner may be tempted to jump in to help, or the ScrumMaster might think they know who should work on what (at no time does the ScrumMaster assign people to work on tasks or tell Developers how to work). But people outside of the Development Team need to let the team learn through self-organization, even if it is initially difficult. A Scrum Coach can help.**
		- Yalor told me MetaCartel is like an organism and I thought, wtf...but now I get it because it's constantly evolving and it's creating technical advances and a social revolution. 
			- An organism, the human body, needs to evolve to survive change - we know change is inevitable - so creating a resilient system is super important for MetaFactory. 
			**- Fashion houses will struggle more because it takes them much longer to self-organize.** 
				- But, Prada does a good job at it. Sure, but Prada doesn't have a curation game to include members, give people voice, and vote on things that matter to them. 
				- Can I tie this in to experimentation and swag DAO?
					- MetaFactory emerged through SwagDAO experimentation, iteration, pivoting. 
	- Robot token is weird
	- maybe this whole premise is scarcity is weird, but like Hammad says, crypto is great for playing with scarcity. 
		- great for monetizing on scarcity. people like exclusive, scarce things. 
		- Is this a paradox? why?
			- kind of seems like metafactory is saying we're not a rich kids club (no, they're not saying that actually, just like prada is not a rich kid's club is not true) but they are playing with cryptoeconomics to incentivize certain behaviors and see what financialization of a scarce asset cana chieve.  
	- Why have a token and call it robot and call people robots? 
	- WTF is bonding curve? And balancer?
	- WTF is iRobot DAO, cryptoeconomics, and why?
