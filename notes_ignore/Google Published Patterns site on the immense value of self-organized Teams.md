#quotes 
To reduce complexity, organizations will standardize structures and processes. This may be through adoption of a best practice or through historical development of the organization’s culture. Best practices develop in a specific context to achieve specific objectives, and these may not suit a given organization ([1], p. 184). **In any complex endeavor, you can rarely forecast ahead of time which of several shared foundations will be the optimal one: you need only something that is ‟good enough,ˮ and let emergence guide you from there.** An organization may develop its own best practice structures and processes at certain times, as situations demand; they become established practices. However, though these approaches usually work for a while, they will not continue to be the best practices as time goes on. **The business situation changes as management approaches advance and technology improves. The team may become stuck at a new plateau.**

**Note that self-organization requires maturity and discipline. Some people are uncomfortable with self-organization. Stakeholders such as the Product Owner may be tempted to jump in to help, or the ScrumMaster might think they know who should work on what (at no time does the ScrumMaster assign people to work on tasks or tell Developers how to work). But people outside of the Development Team need to let the team learn through self-organization, even if it is initially difficult. A Scrum Coach can help.**

**One danger in removing an explicit supervisory role is that another individual (on the team) may fill that same role, forcing his or her will on the team through charisma, bullying, or dominating the conversation. This leaves the team with exactly the same dynamics as it had previously. The ScrumMaster needs to understand this may happen and prepare the team by modeling behaviors that ensure everyone on the Development Team can contribute**. This will help establish norms for the team. If this type of behavior does appear (or anything else that inhibits self-organization) it is the
responsibility of the ScrumMaster to help the team identify and resolve the impediment.
