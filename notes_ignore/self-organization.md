Description: 

self-organization is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system.

In [[content/content/system]] theory the way [[content/content/donnella meadows]] defines self-organization is [[quartz/content/notes/self organization is a system's ability to change itself by creating whole new structures and behaviors]]

[[content/content/self-organization]] occurs in many physical, chemical, biological, robotic, and cognitive systems. Examples of self-organization include crystallization, thermal convection of fluids, chemical oscillation, animal swarming, neural circuits, and black markets.

With respect to structuring teams, [[content/content/self organization is superior to a top down hierarchical structure]].

Self-organized teams can also be called [[content/content/decentralized]] because decision making doesn't take place by a central authority, like a manager, but instead by agents operating autonomously. There are different ways to think about decentralization.
