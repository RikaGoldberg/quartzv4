Early one morning last week a group of about 50 people gathered in Santa Monica shortly after sunrise, before any stores or offices were open. Some of this group knew each other, and others met for the first time. Everyone was wearing clothes that clearly indicated this group belonged together. Coffee and conversation started.

In previous eras, this gathering could have been convened by a faith group, neighborhood association, or trade union. But this was the Rapha Cycle Club  (RCC), a membership organization grown around Rapha’s cycle apparel business. The RCC has all the hallmarks of traditional community groups: rituals, local organizers, chapters and clubhouses around the world, symbols, shared identity, and social activities. There’s also a code of conduct that creates the conditions for respect and decency between diverse members:

RCC members will uphold good riding etiquette and camaraderie and abide by the Rapha/RCC ride etiquette rules. Members will greet other riders on the road, wait for dropped riders, and help those in need.  
— Rapha Cycle Club, Code of Conduct

You can attend art shows, film screenings, expert talks, and local tours. This is not the light “community” that brands often speak of when referring to their customers or social media following–this is real, in-person commitment and engagement. And this is not a sideshow to Rapha’s business. It’s core to its business strategy–its spaces are clubhouses not stores, and people are members not customers.

Why would a for-profit brand put so much work into building belonging? The simple answer is because of the deep brand loyalty it engenders and the commercial opportunities it creates.

The longer answer is: The commercial opportunity exists because we need belonging at a fundamental level . We have a crisis of belonging–and great brands will step into the vacuum created by social isolation.

From being able to care for our elderly or our young, to tackling giant challenges like climate change, mental health, or physical health, community health is fundamental.

Sebastian Junger, the war correspondent, identified diminished social bonds and shared purpose as the driving force of increased incidences of PTSD. In his book, [_Tribe_](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Homecoming-Belonging-Sebastian-Junger/dp/1455566381?tag=wwwfccom-20), Junger recounts the work of Charles Fritz, an observer employed by the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey to assess the morale of British civilians during and after the Blitz in World War II. What he found was not social chaos, but a “community of sufferers” more tightly bonded than before–“mentally healthy conditions.” “Self interest gets subsumed into group interest,” as Junger puts it.

Reweaving the social fabric is of critical importance, to us individually (we’re much happier when part of something good) and collectively.

And some for-profit brands are identifying this opportunity. Thinking beyond “customers,” “fans,” or “followers,” the next frontier for great brands is stepping into the cultural need and market opportunity for deeper, real-world person-to-person connection.

Rapha’s RCC is one example; others actively building tribe (in different ways) include Crossfit, SoulCycle, Sofar Sounds<,OfferUp, Starbucks, and Summit. Apple has made strides in this direction, revising the concept of its stores into "Town Squares,” complete with communal spaces and a host of classes that enable people to gather in different ways, such as [Photo Walks](https://www.apple.com%2Ftoday%2Fprogram%2Fphoto-walks-sessions%2F/) where people learn photography techniques together while exploring their city.

Those companies that help us forge meaningful connections will win deep loyalty. And this needs to go beyond premium brands. If belonging can be built around apparel and technology companies, surely it can also be built around learning, parenthood, food, and health.

Most of the thinking about brand-led community building focuses on what could be described as “fandom”– people loosely aggregated around a brand. The brand is the hero, and people mostly interact with the brand, rather than with each other.

What’s needed are initiatives that truly combat social isolation with enhanced belonging.

Although there are some examples of highly engaged communities being developed via technology (e.g., [Peloton riders](https://www.onepeloton.com/)), when it comes to belonging, real connection will most likely come from in-person interaction in real life. But having physical space is not enough: Brands should create spaces, experiences, products, and services that deliberately foster the conditions for diverse people coming together in respectful environments for shared experiences.
