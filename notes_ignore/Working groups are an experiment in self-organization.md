#Metafactory 


They're cool because they started off as a [[content/content/thought experiment]], and now they're an actual [[experiment]]. 

These are the work in process working groups: 
	- Technicians (Product Project Managers)
	- Fashion/Design R&D
	- Fulfillment/Shopify
	- Customer Service (Shopify, Email, Discord, etc)
	- Live Events (MCON, NFT.NYC, Etc)
	- Metaverse Events (VR, M3 x Webaverse)
	- Content/Story (Written, Video/Audio/Metaverse)
	- Wearables
	- Devs
	- Community/Onboarding (Been all work and no play)
	- Coordination (Optimizing tools/guides for workflows)

For [[iRobot DAO]] it's ROBOT governance & token;
- Governance strucuture, usecase of ROBOT, how ROBOT evolves over time, ROBOT north star, exchanges, etc.
- ROBOT liquidity; How ROBOT liquidity is managed (amounts, which chain, etc), incentivised (ROBOT rewards, exclusive drops, etc).
- ROBOT diversifaction; How ROBOT should be diversified, sold, strategic rounds, etc.
- ROBOT distribution; How many ROBOT tokens are being distributed, for what reasons, with what outcome.
- ROBOT anaylsis; How ROBOT tokens are moving across the ecosystem, who is selling, buying. Drawing meaningful conclusions for the wider MF community.
