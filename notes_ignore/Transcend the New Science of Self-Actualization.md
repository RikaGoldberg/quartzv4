[[Alfred Adler|Adler]] wrote about people turning their challenges and deficits into growth and strength. Having suffered from rickets in childhood, Adler personally knew how potent the feelings of adequacy or inferiority were and argued that overcoming or channeling such feeling in healthy directions was necessary for succesful adaptation to life. Adler believed that one of the most powerful paths for overcoming the seductive allure of power over others was cultivating the drive for social interest. Adler distinguished between striving for power and striving for mastery and overcoming obstacles. He argued that both offer ways of satisfying our "striving for perfection" but that the mastery drive is more about overcoming one's personal challenges than wielding power over others.
