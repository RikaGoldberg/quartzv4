I believe the 60k from skale needs to be taxed as other income, maybe like a bonus would. 

Q: Which address did i unlock skale tokens with?
Q: Does Coinbase IRS report show I received 60k? If yes, IRS may wonder if it was an airdrop or if I received it from a friend or where it came from. If my friend sent me 60k is that considered a taxable gift?
	Q: Why does cointracker not pick up the 60k as other income?
Q: Should I consult with gabe?

**Additionally, I want to look in my old notebook when I get home to see if I wrote down any guidance from cpa. I know he advised me to get quickbooks for my business, and I looked into it, but decided I can do in excel what quickbooks does, which i think is just track cost basis.**

I should create another address for business payments.

What happens if I don't report the 4k received? Can irs track it? Yes, once I transfer to fiat. 

**Update**
Transaction report on coinbase just shows 200,000k skale tokens were received. Coin tracker does show sale though and it has fair market value. IRS may wonder...where did I get them? Who sent them? Did I buy them? If yes, then capital gain only. If airdrop, other income. 

**Update post Jack call
He said proof of stake tokens are treated like livestock, which is taxed like created property, so capital gains? not sure. he will send me docs. 

but I did not stake any tokens. I sold them all immediately on coinbase and cointracker shows my fmv as the market price on the day i sold them, not zero. 

Jack said no forms were sent to IRS. doesn't sound like it's an airdrop eithr because the tokens went to an escrow contract, not to a wallet.
