In Season 3, The Foundation identified three criteria that it deemed important and specific votes for each criteria to gauge participation.

Criteria: increased resiliency of the governance system, participated in reflection period, and contributed across the Collective. 

Specific votes: Agora test vote, voting in Reflection period so special cycle #9a or #9b and badgeholder elections, and nominated a final project for RetroPGF. 

They did not use an across-the-board participation metric based on quantity of votes. Delegates had to vote on specific items that foundation deemed was important to the collective. 

Max available to delegates is 3250 OP. 

But...

Grants council got additional retroactive reward (10000 OP each) in addition to their seasonal amounts!
