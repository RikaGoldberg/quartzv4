In a previous article, on DAO delegate compensation, I captured the main themes of Arbitrumâ€™s values:
1. growth to attract builders, onboard new users, be efficient, and sustainable
2. decentralization for fairness, transparency, to foster education and avoid conflicts of interest

Arbitrum is innovating on DeFi with protocols like Uniswap, GMX, Radiant, Aave, Stargate, etc.
