#summary 
Hypebeast brands create hype through scarcity and limited edition goods. Aficionados will seek out these brands, like sneakers and other streetwear, because it gives them a sense of belonging and "cool" but they're also discerning customers and know what they can resell. Birkin bags are like a store of value. They go up in value but you also need to be in the subculture to even know what to buy.   
 
Resale markets are emerging that charge 1k% markup. Reminds me of concert tickets that get sold out. There's a finite number of seats and it's a hot event. It's physically impossible for everyone to attend. Space is limited. 

Fashion designers do this too with limited goods. Like the Birkin bag. It's like a store of value. Or art work.

Adidas had just released the latest shoe in the Yeezy Boost collection, its famed footwear collaboration with Kanye West. This sneaker – the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 – was not a new model, and cost $220, the same as other sneakers in the range. The difference was the colour: Semi Frozen Yellow, a muted fluorescent hue with grey and red highlights.

For those in the know, this was a huge deal. Sneakers or trainers in this particular colour were the most limited release to date, and would fetch big sums on the lucrative resale market. For days before the sneaker was available for sale, forums and Instagram accounts buzzed with hype of the release.

**Welcome to the world of the “drop”, a sales tactic deployed by a number of streetwear brands to supercharge the traditional supply-and-demand model.**

**An announcement on social media about the limited release of, say, a new sneaker is all it takes to cue the hype. Next, the message is amplified across social media, especially Instagram, where celebrities, fashion-forward influencers, and collectors create an echo chamber of excitement.** 

**Once these items are released, some can sell out in a matter of seconds before emerging on resale websites, marked up 1,000% or more. For the brands who have mastered the art of the drop, and for the legions of fans buying and reselling their products, such hype can produce remarkably lucrative results.**

**Supreme has built its reputation on maintaining product scarcity, collaborations with other brands or designers and limited releases of odd accessories such as hair clippers, nunchucks, and dog bowls.** The Supreme box logo is far more than just a label, but a brand insignia that endows any item with cult appeal. In 2016, Supreme even released a branded brick, which sold out in minutes. Streetwear culture site Highsnobiety said the novelty item showed Supreme’s “sadomasochistic relationship with its fans.”

“If you want to create a scarcity frenzy, and your brand has a strong following, all you need to do is release a large number of different products, but very few of each one,” says Adam Alter, a marketing professor at NYU Stern School of Business and the author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.

“The beauty of fashion is that it’s conspicuous; everyone knows what you’re wearing, so if you’re wearing a scarce, fashionable product, you get the benefit of knowing privately that you own something scarce, but also the benefit of being able to show other people that you own a scarce product.”

“**The culture is about exclusivity.** When people post Instagram selfies of themselves wearing these items, people get jealous and it just grows from there,” says Kyle Maiorano, a 20-year-old university student majoring in business studies at Binghamton University in upstate New York. Maiorano goes by the handle KicksbyK on Instagram, where recent posts show tantalising images of multiple yellow Yeezys, or sneaker boxes piled high in his room.

Entrepreneurial streetwear fans such as Maiorano find their customers through online marketplaces such as GOAT, Grailed, or StockX.

StockX describes itself as the stock market of things. Since it was founded in February 2016, it has grown to become the largest sneaker marketplace in the world, but it also sells Supreme streetwear, luxury handbags and watches.

The site operates using the same principles as the stock market, bringing buyers and sellers together at the same time. “We can create a market price for consumer goods,” says Josh Luber, the CEO of StockX. “When Adidas puts out a pair of Yeezys with a retail price of $225, that has no bearing at all to what the market price of that thing is worth. StockX gets to a market price (the difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask) then allows both parties, buyers and seller to transact across that price.”

Luber says this secondary market in goods has always existed, but now thanks to social media and the access of buying and selling online, “we’re in a golden age of consumer secondary markets”.

**his business of hype has a curious parallel – in the world of super-expensive high fashion.**

 “Limited-edition collections have long been a feature of luxury brands,” explains Avery Booker, the CEO of Enflux, a data-tech company that helps companies predict trends and consumer behaviour.

**Take, for example, the Birkin bag, a legendary accessory made by French fashion house Hermès.** It is considered by handbag hunters to be the “holy grail.” The lowest retail price of a Birkin directly from Hermès is approximately $10,900, according to Evelyn Fox, the co-founder of Baghunter, an online handbag marketplace. Rare versions, however, can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. They also hold their value. According to a Baghunter study, the market price for Birkins has risen an average 14% per year over the last 35 years, making it a better investment than gold.

**But unlike a Birkin bag or a DeBeers diamond, the exclusivity of streetwear brands like Supreme isn’t based on price, but because it’s impossible to acquire unless you’re tapped into the subculture.** There’s credibility in owning something that few others managed to grab. **“When you own a scarce, fashionable product, you align yourself with an esteemed social group,” says Adam Alter. “You’re investing in your social image.”**

**“At the end of the day, this drop culture really is a trend built for and maintained by a young consumer,” says Booker. “The younger customer is already well tuned into it. They have a unique eye, they know what they can resell, and they know many brands. I think they are very discerning customers in a way, which is fascinating.**

“You can’t fake your way into being a sought-after brand.”
