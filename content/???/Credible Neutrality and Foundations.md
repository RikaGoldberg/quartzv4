Popularized by Compound Governor, delegation has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the vote-weight utilization in many DAOs; consolidating vote-weight in the hands of those who have the time and inclination to actively participate in governance by allowing users to delegate their vote weight to others.

Capture resistant - no one stakeholder group can gain control of the protocol
Credible neutrality is dependability. It means a stakeholder (e.g a user or a developer) can use or build on a protocol with confidence it will [not change against their interests](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/). **Protocols remain credibly neutral by avoiding "capture" by any particular group.**

The pattern of using a foundation to coordinate protocol development goes back to early 2013 with the inception of the Mastercoin foundation.

It is likely that most crypto projects will transition from foundations to DAOs over the next few years. It will take only a few successful examples for this transition to accelerate and we intend for Synthetix to be one of those successes.

**When you work at a VC fund, you need to be on the cutting edge of trends. You need to see trends coming. Predictions-esque. I write about trends that already happened. After the "hype", I write about the established product/service/dao. Would that make me a bad VC?**
