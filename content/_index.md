## Introduction ü´ñ
Hi Readers, 

Welcome to my public notes. I write about finance, psychology, systems theory,  Web3/Crypto, and the craft of writing. 

You're probably thinking: Web3/Crypto is a Ponzi scheme. A burning house of cards. 

Maybe. 

I'm not a fortune teller. 

My role is to share my experience and knowledge to help you form your own perspective. 

I read, research, and write. 

Skepticism and discourse are highly encouraged. 

Let's talk.

## üíÄ Personal Philosophy 
Borrowing from the late Abraham Maslow and the living Scott Barry Kaufman, 
> Life isn‚Äôt a trek up a summit. It‚Äôs more like a vast ocean, full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery but also danger and uncertainty. In this choppy surf, a pyramid is of little use. What we really need is something more flexible and functional: a _sailboat_.

Keep an active archive because we are all in the state of becoming. 

In order to navigate through the good and the bad times, it's important to develop a healthy confidence -- showing up in a way that is not centered around external validation.
