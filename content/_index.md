## 🤖 Welcome to my digital garden
This is my space for sharpening my thinking, through writing and building in public. Everything in here is evergreen and therefore subject to change as my thinking changes. If you notice that something is factually wrong, please let me know 🙏

If my thinking resonates with you and/or you want to learn how to create your own digital garden, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RikaGoldberg). You can also [schedule a coffee chat](https://calendly.com/rikagoldberg628/30min?back=1&month=2022-04) with me. If you live in the Bay Area, I am very down to meet up IRL because in-person coffee chats are the best. 

This digital garden is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). BIG shout out to [Jackie Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) for his time and skills. 🙏


## 💀 About me
In the Fall of 2020, I read a book that changed my life. [Thinking in Systems](notes/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md) by [Donella Meadows](/notes/Donella%20Meadows.md) has not only been a great companion during the pandemic, but it has also shaped my thinking about crypto and [DAOs](/notes/YODA.md) 

Another book that changed my life is [Transcend The New Science of Self Actualization](/notes/Transcend%20The%20New%20Science%20of%20Self%20Actualization.md) by the psychologist [Scott Barry Kaufman](/notes/Scott%20Barry%20Kaufman.md). Drawing from the teachings of Abraham Maslow, Scott dives into how each one of us can reach our true potential. 

The biggest myth about Maslow is that our needs are arranged in a hierarchy. Somewhere, somehow, some wires got crossed and schools started to teach kids that our needs are hierarchical. Scott writes: 
> Life isn’t a trek up a summit. It’s more like a vast ocean, full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery but also danger and uncertainty. In this choppy surf, a pyramid is of little use. What we really need is something more flexible and functional: a _sailboat_.

Because [life is not a game](notes/life%20is%20not%20a%20game.md) (although if you stay on Twitter too long, it may start to feel that way) so it's important to develop a healthy confidence (not centered around external validation) to help you navigate through the good and the bad times. 

Borrowing from Scott, **this is me. hey, what's up?**
