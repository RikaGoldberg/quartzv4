title: "Working in Public"
---

Hi, my name is Rika, and I am a full-time [Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a.k.a. DAO](/notes/Decentralized%20Autonomous%20Organization,%20DAO.md) contributor.  I believe in [working with the garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). This means I share my work and my thoughts in public, on this website. The site is minimal, so you can click on any link and start to go down that topic's rabbit hole. 

First and foremost, I am a writer who is interested in [systems thinking](/notes/Systems%20thinking.md) and emerging complex systems, like [DAOs](/notes/Decentralized%20Autonomous%20Organization,%20DAO.md). I am also interested in [money](/notes/Money.md), which as Vitalik recently pointed out, continues to be [the most important cryptocurrency app](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html).

#### Quotes

> In simplicity of **structure the tree** is **comparable to the compulsive desire for neatness and order** that insists the candlesticks on a mantelpiece be perfectly straight and perfectly symmetrical about the centre. **The semilattice, by comparison,** is the **structure of a complex fabric**; it is the **structure of living things, of great paintings and symphonies**.

\- Christopher Alexander [A City is Not a Tree](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf), 1965

> **Life isn’t a trek up a summit.** It’s more like a **vast ocean**, **full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery** but also **danger and uncertainty**. In this choppy surf, a pyramid is of little use. What we really need is something more **flexible and functional: a _sailboat_**.

\-  Scott Barry Kaufman, [Transcend: The New Science of Self Actualization](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49625550), 2020
