title: "Working in Public"

Hi, my name is Rika, and I am a full-time [Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a.k.a. DAO](/notes/Decentralized%20Autonomous%20Organization,%20DAO.md) contributor.  I believe in [working with the garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) so I use this website to share my work and thoughts. If you feel called to do so, click on any link and start to go down that topic's rabbit hole (kind of like you would on Wikipedia).

First and foremost, I am a writer who is interested in [systems thinking](/notes/Systems%20thinking.md) and emerging complex systems, like [DAOs](/notes/Decentralized%20Autonomous%20Organization,%20DAO.md). I am also interested in [money](/notes/Money.md), which as Vitalik recently pointed out, continues to be [the most important cryptocurrency app](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html).

### Top of Mind 

>One of the challenges is just keeping up with the web3 space while being in the space. I could spend 16 hours a day just reading Twitter and Discord and talking to people and checking out other projects. And because the space is moving so fast, there’s a lot of real value in that. That’s not just a distraction, that’s real research – but if that’s all you do, you don’t get anything built.
