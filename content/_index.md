## Welcome to my digital garden
This is my space for noting and nurturing thoughts, just like a plant, so my ideas grow into a bounty. I believe in the power of sharing and building in public. If any of my ideas spark interest in you, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RikaGoldberg) or [schedule a coffee chat](https://calendly.com/rikagoldberg628/30min?back=1&month=2022-04). If you live in the Bay Area, let's meet up in person. üåâ

## üíÄ About me
I'm working on myself. In the fall of 2020, soon after the Covid-19 pandemic started, I took a sabbatical. The first 6 months were really rough. I didn't know what to do with all of my time and felt [existential dread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_crisis). My identity was completely wrapped up in my work. I was a crypto Product Manager and I couldn't fathom giving that up, even though it wasn't working for me. Another part of my identity was wrapped up in being a hard worker. I was extremely proud of that, but I had no idea the toll that it was taking on my wellbeing. I was completely disconnected from myself and my relationships were suffering. I was quite unhappy. 

And then I found online communities. I joined [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/), [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Foster](https://www.foster.co/). I learned that I don't have to be boxed-in to one path and I don't have to fear choice. I can follow my curiosity and work on my passions. I don't have to be any one thing. I can be many things and develop a taste for what I like. 

This digital garden is my pet project. As I mentioned above, it's a place where I note ideas and nurture thoughts.

I'm no longer trying to prove anything to anyone. I'm just trying to be the best version of myself. Borrowing from one of my favorite psychologists, Scott Barry Kaufman, **this is me. hey, what's up?**
