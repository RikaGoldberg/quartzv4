## Personal Philosophy 
Borrowing from the late Abraham Maslow and the living Scott Barry Kaufman
> Life isn‚Äôt a trek up a summit. It‚Äôs more like a vast ocean, full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery but also danger and uncertainty. In this choppy surf, a pyramid is of little use. What we really need is something more flexible and functional: a _sailboat_.

Keep an active archive because we are all in the state of becoming. 

In order to navigate through the good and the bad times, it's important to develop a healthy confidence -- showing up in a way that is not centered around external validation.
