## The Practice of Digital Gardening

> In simplicity of structure the tree is comparable to the compulsive desire for neatness and order that insists the candlesticks on a mantelpiece be perfectly straight and perfectly symmetrical about the centre. The semilattice, by comparison, is the structure of a complex fabric; it is the structure of living things, of great paintings and symphonies.

\- Christopher Alexander [A City is Not a Tree](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf), 1965

My notes are messy (by design) and heavily influenced by the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) method and the book [How To Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes)

In the interest of not being too rigid (i.e., neat and ordered, as per Christopher Alexander), I try to avoid systematizing these notes *too much*. As a big fan of [Systems thinking](/notes/Systems%20thinking.md), I do infuse these notes with ideas and concepts from complex system design. 

These notes are constantly evolving, being shaped by my experience and learnings as I grow and change.

> Life isn‚Äôt a trek up a summit. It‚Äôs more like a vast ocean, full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery but also danger and uncertainty. In this choppy surf, a pyramid is of little use. What we really need is something more flexible and functional: a _sailboat_.

\-  Scott Barry Kaufman, [Transcend: The New Science of Self Actualization](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49625550), 2020
