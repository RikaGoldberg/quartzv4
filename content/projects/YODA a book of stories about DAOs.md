I received funding from [MetaCartel](quartz/notes_ignore/MetaCartel.md) to write nonfiction stories about the MetaCartel family of [DAO Wei1](quartz/content/notes/DAO%20Wei1.md)s.  

The goal is to write informative, interesting, and fun narratives toonboard more talented non-technical people into the space and make [DAO Wei1](quartz/content/notes/DAO%20Wei1.md)s less exclusive.
