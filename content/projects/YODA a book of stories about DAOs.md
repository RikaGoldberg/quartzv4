I received funding from [MetaCartel](quartz/notes_ignore/MetaCartel.md) to write nonfiction stories about the MetaCartel family of [DAO Wei1](quartz/content/notes/DAO%20Wei1.md)s.  

The goal is to write informative, interesting, and fun narratives toonboard more talented non-technical people into the space and make [DAO Wei1](quartz/content/notes/DAO%20Wei1.md)s less exclusive. 

### anthology series
*[Story #1: MetaCartel DAO](https://mirror.xyz/rikasukenik.eth/ypr4aOWQIJqyvY3vxNgWk9YMfysXOzd62bPPLexY2Mg)  status = published
> This is my first short story in an anthology of short stories, a book, about DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). This first short story memes its way into existence, following the journey of MetaCartel DAO, the second DAO to ever exist.
