Goal: Grant writing

Leveraging https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/645 and  https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1399

What is Quest Chains?
Quest Chains is a permissionless learning and educational platform for DAOs and their contributors. Quest Chains enables DAO communities to create courses and issue "proof-of-knowledge" custom NFT rewards for successfully completing courses. 

We have previously received a Filecoin grant that enabled us to build an interoperable system that enables DAO communities to easily integrate Quest Chains into their tech stack, using their own branded assets to create a custom experience for their DAO members. 

Today, we are seeking a grant from the EF to focus on the Product so we can conduct user research and develop a strategy and path to sustainability. By building an educational platform that rewards learning, we hope to incentivize the spread of quality knowledge and increase participation in DAOs.
