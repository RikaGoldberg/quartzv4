During yesterday's Octagon sync, Alec shared details of the ComposeDB integration. I came up with an idea to co-market with the Ceramic team, so Alec added me to the ongoing MG/Ceramic thread. 

I was introduced to Corrado & Kiara who I will be working with on co-marketing and partnership/biz. dev. 

In the meantime, I'm reading about ComposeDB and Sena's vision for how the Metaverse will replace the Cloud. People will be able to, with no-code, create applications utilizing common profile & social data. Social media identity is a core part of how we form trust and connection with people. 

MetaGame is using ComposeDB for MyMeta profiles. Players' profile data is stored in ComposeDB. This creates interesting opportunities for other projects to use the profiles data that we are storing. We can also collect analytics from the DRC Quest Chains, as an onboarding mechanism for people to create profiles on MetaGame.
