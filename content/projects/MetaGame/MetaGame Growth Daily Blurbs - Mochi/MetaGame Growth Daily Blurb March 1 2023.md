Reading posts from Machinations blog to prep for ETHPorto talk. 

I love this quote from https://machinations.io/articles/community-spotlight-spacedogs-journey-into-web3/

"One of the challenges is just keeping up with the web3 space while being in the space. I could spend 16 hours a day just reading Twitter and Discord and talking to people and checking out other projects. And because the space is moving so fast, there’s a lot of real value in that. That’s not just a distraction, that’s real research – but if that’s all you do, you don’t get anything built."

And this one:

"It’s like this whole new design space opened up for things that we couldn’t do anywhere else. The aesthetic is different and there are all kinds of ideas that you can put in this space that wouldn’t necessarily be the right vibe elsewhere. We’re having way more fun than we were having working before – it just felt really freeing and exciting."
