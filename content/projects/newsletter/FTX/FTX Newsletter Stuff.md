FTX Post
- SBF is a sociopath who lied, and lied. 
- He co-mingled funds
- He created a token out of thin air
- Is he an idiot or was this an honest mistake? 
- bring it back to me & to dao people: 
- Is being a DAO person possible? Is it sustainable? 
- I don't want to be a know-it-all in this post. 

My Goal: 
I don't really know. I'm like that AI machine who doesn't know what she wants. 

I can write about MetaCartel. 

Synthesis is what I want to do.  Storytelling. 

The ends justify the means. Utilitarianism.

I'm curious: Do the ends ever justify the means? 
(Also, why is it not possible to send money overseas via banks?)
What is an effective altruist?
What is utilitarianism?
What shitcoins were on FTX's balance sheet? 

Why am I wondering this? 
Because of SBF who was a very charitable person. 
Because Yalor at MetaCartel who starts shit.
