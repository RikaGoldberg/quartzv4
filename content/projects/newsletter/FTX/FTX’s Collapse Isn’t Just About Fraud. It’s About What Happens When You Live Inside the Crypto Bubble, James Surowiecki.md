### Highlights
As a result, watching the interview will not give you a clearer understanding of whether, as many reports have claimed, FTX illegally (or at least unethically) funneled customer assets to Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund SBF also founded, in a foolhardy attempt to let Alameda make big bets on crypto.

What, after all, ultimately brought FTX down was that it had made huge margin loans to Alameda, so that it could make highly-leveraged bets on other crypto assets. Some of those loans may have been funded with assets from customers who had never agreed to let their money be lent out, which would be fraud.

**Instead, what wrecked it was that it lent out far more money to Alameda than it should have, and that it then failed to call those loans, and force Alameda to liquidate its positions, when it should have.**

That’s why, in today’s interview, Bankman-Fried said FTX “completely failed” on risk management, and insisted that he hadn’t realized until too late how big Alameda’s positions (meaning its bets on crypto) were.

And I think what that tells you is that this was someone who was essentially living inside the crypto bubble, where every dip is an opportunity to buy, and the fundamentally Ponzi-esque aspect of almost all crypto assets is not something to worry about.

After all, by any normal standard of risk management, lending billions of dollars to a hedge fund to make highly-leveraged bets on fake-money assets is an insane thing to do, particularly when those loans are collateralized (as the loans to Alameda were) primarily by piles of your own tokens. The only way that could possibly seem like a sensible business strategy would be if you thought there was no real downside risk. And the only way you could think that would be if you were living inside an ecosystem built on a delusion. Which seems to be exactly what Sam Bankman-Fried was doing.

He also thought funding huge leveraged bets on random crypto assets, even after things like the Luna collapse had happened, was either a smart thing to do or at least something he wasn’t worried enough about to monitor. This was not the behavior of a cynic. It was the behavior of a true believer, even if all he believed in was that the crypto bubble would never really burst.
