FTX was a shit show. Everyone knows it and its clearly fraud
- I am writing about FTX from a psychology, human personality lens. Who was this crazy guy? What personality did he have? I am curious about why people trusted him with their money when he was bad shit crazy. People saw warning signs, like his poor articulation, body language, likes and ums in his speech, all tell tale signs that he was bullshitting
- FTX rose to be a top exchange within 3 years because, supposedly, they had one of the best technology platforms for traders. SBF raised money and established trust with leading people, all who had no idea about how mismanaged funds were, with holes in balance sheets, with Excel spreadhsheets, with young people all dating each other. 
- WeWork was a massive scam too with back of the envelope deals and very little process
- The problem is not with the process or with regulation, it's with people. It's with human character and flaws and defects. 
- Moral philosophy, like Greek tragedies, discuss the luck of humans. What it means for good things to happen to bad people and bad things to happen to good people. How a persons life circumstances can influence and shape them as a person. Some greek heroes, tragedians, were okay people but they got caught doing bad things. They're bad people. 
- My Accounting professor in college told the class she never wants to see anyone's face on the cover of the Wall Street Journal. She would be ashamed if any of her students committed an Enron debacle. 
- I am an open book. I like to share my past because it builds trust with people.
