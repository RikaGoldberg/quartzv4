* SECTION HEADING: One big circle jerk (FTT in the middle) 
* Alameda and FTX are two separate companies
	* SBF said Alameda was just a liquidity provider
	* Co-mingled funds
	* [Alameda borrowed $10 billion of customer deposits from FTX, using its own token (FTT), that was created out of thin air, as collateral. Then, Alameda borrowed other crypto with FTT from FTX](Alameda%20borrowed%20$10%20billion%20of%20customer%20deposits%20from%20FTX,%20using%20its%20own%20token%20(FTT),%20that%20was%20created%20out%20of%20thin%20air,%20as%20collateral.%20Then,%20Alameda%20borrowed%20other%20crypto%20with%20FTT%20from%20FTX.md)
	* Reseve requirement for banks is 25% (National Bank Act of 1863)
		* https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp
* Internal hack
* Customer assets were held offshore in the bahamas (violating terms of use)
	* Assets were supposed to be frozen when Ch. 11 hit but instead the bahamian government started to move money out of FTX exchange
* Ch. 11 bankruptcy should have been done on Friday Nov. 11 not Monday Nov. 14
* SECTION HEADING: CZ is two-faced??
	* Binance was the first investor and incubator. CZ taught SBF ropes but also had money from Alameda
	* CZ signaled he would dump FTT. Value of FTT plummeted. 
	* FTT was collateral on DeFi loans, so those loans were undercollateralized.
	* [Binance offered to buy FTX and said they will conduct a full due diligence. Then, the next day, CZ withdrew his offer stating because of US agency investigations.](Binance%20offered%20to%20buy%20FTX%20and%20said%20they%20will%20conduct%20a%20full%20due%20diligence.%20Then,%20the%20next%20day,%20CZ%20withdrew%20his%20offer%20stating%20because%20of%20US%20agency%20investigations.)
* Kruger says FTX was the best exchange tech wise
* FTX printed money by creating FTT then Serum then they kept printing shitcoins
	* Using their own liquidity to manipulate the price and then taking loans against the balance sheet (with tokens, printed money) as collateral. 
	* Putting money into DeFi & using tokens as collateral
	* SECTION HEADING: Shitcoins should not be collateral
* Non crypto markets wealth dropped from 3T (size of crypto economy) to .5B (DATA CHECK)
	* Impact to economy is huge
	* Employees felt rich so buying stuff
	* AWS was 2nd biggest expense on BS. Now, not spending money on that. 
	* Old economists didn't realize the impact crypto has on markets (spending)
* FTT was clearly a Ponzi insider
	* all of the insiders dated each other
	* [Crazy thing is that FTX's chief regulatory officer (head of compliance) DAniel Friedburg was behind the Poker cheating scandals at Ultimate Bet (UB) and Absolute Poker in 2008, cheating players out of $50 million.](Crazy%20thing%20is%20that%20FTX's%20chief%20regulatory%20officer%20(head%20of%20compliance)%20DAniel%20Friedburg%20was%20behind%20the%20Poker%20cheating%20scandals%20at%20Ultimate%20Bet%20(UB)%20and%20Absolute%20Poker%20in%202008,%20cheating%20players%20out%20of%20$50%20million.)
* Circularity is a common theme
	* Enron & now FTX
	* Equity shouldn't be used as collateral. Instead, debt or things at the bottom of cap. table
	* For coders, circular code is hard to debug and when it unravels it unravels quickly. 
* Contagion risk
	* [Firms, like Multicoin Capital, that had money with FTX (Multi had 10% of its portfolio with them) are going through bankruptcy court. Other firms are attempting to access emergency funding](Firms,%20like%20Multicoin%20Capital,%20that%20had%20money%20with%20FTX%20(Multi%20had%2010%%20of%20its%20portfolio%20with%20them)%20are%20going%20through%20bankruptcy%20court.%20Other%20firms%20are%20attempting%20to%20access%20emergency%20funding)
* FTX Ventures bought a 30% stake in Skybridge
	* So does skybridge have worthless FTT on its balance sheet?
