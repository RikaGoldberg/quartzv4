If you are curious about the above illustration, it is by Nadiaa Docheva, a Ukranian artist. The illustration is from the book Northern Lights, part one of a three-part fantasy novel trilogy called His Dark Materials. I feel like it has a cerebral effect, transporting us to a parallel universe, and, aaahh, don‚Äôt we all just want to escape right now from reality?

I have found it pleasant to complement the above illustration with the below audio, remixed by Damir Zinnatshin, a.k.a. Breath of Music, a musician from Moscow. He has created a beautiful soundtrack of funky, retro songs from the USSR. The lyrics are in Russian, but you can hear the soul in the melody. The songs are about love, nature, and work, capturing the human spirit. I find the music invigorating, and I hope you do too. Let me know what you think.

This past week, I have been channeling my creative energy to build a digital garden. This is my corner of the Internet where I think and share my work in public. My intention was to make it an aesthetically pleasant space, a delight to meander through.

If you have been following my newsletter for a bit, you know that I have been mildly obsessed with note-taking and building a Zettelkasten. I am happy to say that I have found more harmony with my note-taking practice and loosened up my rigidity. Actually, simply changing the language I use to describe my note-taking practice, from Zettelkasten, which sounds structured, formulaic, and masculine, to digital garden, which sounds emergent, full of life, and feminine, brought more joy into my life.

You can meander through my digital garden on my personal website here.

Check it out and let me know what you the think. The dream is to find a way to make it a collaborative space so visitors can leave comments and share links. Why? Because learning is more fun when it‚Äôs collaborative.

As NFL Quarterback Drew Brees once said:

You can‚Äôt compete with someone having fun

Take care, my friends. Be well. ‚ù§Ô∏è
