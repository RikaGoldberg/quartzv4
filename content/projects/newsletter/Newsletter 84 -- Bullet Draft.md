* FTX was a centralized derivatives exchange where traders could place large bets using high leverage e.g, 125x but derivatives are for farmers who want to hedge against losses when the price of crops drops.  Traders hedge against crypto dropping by buying futures which is making a bet that crypto is going to go down. 

* Some people think FTX fraud will make more people use dex's (for crypto natives) and crypto fiat onramps that bypass exchanges, like for example metamask, but arguably more simple for newbies is using stripe to purchase crypto, which is not that much different than using cash app or square to buy crypto. 

* When using crypto, it's important to use proven principles from economics and finance.
