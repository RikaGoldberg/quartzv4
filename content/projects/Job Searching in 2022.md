On Friday July 15, I am at JFK airport at the airline lounge. A glass of Prosecco is fizzy bubbling, the lounge is bustling like crazy. I am listening to breath_of_music on Soundcloud. Hawaiian music is playing.  
New and eclectic, not my usual Spotify algorithm. 

I am starting the job search process. I am documenting it, learning in public, because I hope my process will help others and that I will create opportunities for myself by searching with the office door open. I want to give you insight into my process and help myself too. It's a win-win. Grow the pie. 

I started writing online because I followed many people who talked about the benefit of writing and working in public. Doors open. People come to find you. The "others," the ones you resonate with. The ones you'd be a good culture fit to work with. People who, like me, have an abundance mindset and want to collaboratively work with others. 

This is me, hey, what's up. Here's what I can offer. The end goal is so unclear but it's the process that matters. 

Two years ago, I started this crazy journey of writing online, making Internet friends, and joining fluid crypto organizations called DAOs. The intent was to explore my curiosity, make an intellectual home on the Internet, and find my people. What better way to tell people about myself than through my writing portfolio. So much better than a resume and interviews. The places I want to work will love and appreciate the full me. Yes, I used the word love for work. There are different kinds of love. And it's important to develop a love for your coworkers (like the different loves in Greek).

I am starting with two paths: 

- academic: a research institution like my alma mater Georgia Tech. Writing thought leadership about blockchain. Helping a professor/associate professor with their research. The space is wide open. Do I need a masters degree or some specialized training? IDK. 
- startup: writing content for a startup. But not shitty SEO clickbait and traditional company blogs. Quality content. Alive content. The purpose is to educate and add intellectual value for the readers. To satiate their curiosity. The audience is people who appreciate that. Because it's the best way to do things that are in line with my values. Many people know that the algorithm wars that most company blogs compete in incentivizes garbage writing, intended to sell content and products that fuel the capitalistic wheels. 
	- I'm not anti-capitilism. I'm not some crazy wack job. I'm just someone who understands the problem with our current system, one that exploits customers, like all of the scam crypto projects that crypto a bad name. Or the content that says crypto is a ponzi scheme. Fear, complaining, and negativity sells. 
		- Imagine if everyone was kind, nice, happy, and optimistic. If at the airport, people didn't complain...
