Foundation missteps:

1. AIP 1 asked for 750M ARB to be moved to a "special purpose administrative wallet" to fund special grants, startup costs, payment to service providers. Community noticed that the funds were moved before AIP1 was ratified. Also 750M had no vesting period.
2. 50M ARB was moved. 40M loan to wintermute. 10M to cover operating costs.
3. 5M too much to submit proposals

7.5% allocation to an ecosystem fund sounds fair.
