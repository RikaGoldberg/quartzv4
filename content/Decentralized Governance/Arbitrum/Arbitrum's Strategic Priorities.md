"Serving sequencer fees to the DAO and hosting critical multisig elections via smart contracts are hallmark characteristics of Arbitrumâ€™s DAO and founding values. **Decentralization is not only a desire, but a critical requirement of the technology AND its governance**. **Arbitrum provides the ideal technology stack to ensure a user who puts their assets in the system and interacts with smart contracts is maximally protected from the whims of the system operator.**

**This neutrality is not an option, but a requirement which must be a priority of the DAO. History saw Facebook rug Zynga about a decade after AOL rugged developers in the same way.**
