DAOs don't like service providers. They like contributions & campaigns. Less solutioning, more coming up together collectivity with delegates, brainstorming. Working together. 

Talk to 404 DAO about this, then write in the hackathon group about the idea of having a hackathon to hack on delegate comp. 

Eugene's **grants report** came up, as showcasing inefficiencies of grants. 

Diversify time spent. Work with other delegates collaboratively on what you believe is important. Don't spread too thin. Choose what to collaborate on wisely...
