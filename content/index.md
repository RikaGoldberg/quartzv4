title: Welcome to my notes

Welcome! This is my corner of the internet where I follow threads of curiosity across crypto, finance, governance, and decentralized social networks—and occasionally wander beyond.  

What you’ll find here is a mix: some notes are messy ideas, others are more fully-formed essays, and plenty are just notes and highlights on thought-provoking articles and papers. Together they make up a living notebook that is always growing with new ideas and reshaping as my interests change. 

The notebook, by design, is never quite finished.

## Start Here

You can start by exploring the sidebar on the left.

A couple more things to point out:
- the left sidebar surfaces a random note on each refresh
- each page (except this one) shows a graph of connected notes
- don't underestimate the power of the Search bar!
