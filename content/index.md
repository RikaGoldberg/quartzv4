title: Hey hey - i'm rika, a freelance writer and a DAO Operator
---
Welcome! I spend most of my work time **researching**, **writing**, and **participating in DAOs**. I am a **generalist** and write about crypto topics that  make me curious. Once I'm hooked on a topic, I will conduct research and immerse myself in the community. I'm fairly technical (you have to be in crypto!), which means that I don't just write about technology -- I use it too. 

You can read my [[Published Writing|long-form published writing]] and subscribe to my newsletter [Sharing is Caring](https://www.newsletter.rikagoldberg.com/).

The rest of my website serves as a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), a space where I think and take notes before publishing long-form content. It also doubles as a notes repository to help me jumpstart projects. 

## ⚗️ Digital Garden:

#seeds     **form the basis for ideas an thoughts**

#saplings  **single nodes or thoughts**

#fruits      **new pieces of content**
