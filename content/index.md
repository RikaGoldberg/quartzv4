### My Background ✔️

I'm a former CPA and alumni of [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html) and [ConsenSys](https://consensys.io/). Currently, I contribute to the governance team of [404 DAO](https://404-dao.notion.site/404-DAO-Governance-519af67dccd84df7b1d9dc50312fd813). We are active delegates in [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). 

You can find me on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/RikaGoldberg) and on [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/rikasukenik.eth)

Additionally, I write a newsletter called [Sharing is Caring](https://paragraph.xyz/@sharingiscaring) where I break down Ethereum protocols and products. My newsletter on [Substack](https://www.newsletter.rikagoldberg.xyz/) is no longer maintained but it houses a lot of my early writing. 

## 🌳 Digital Garden:

This site also serves as a digital garden, where I formulate thoughts and ideas into finished pieces of writing.

#seeds     **form the basis for ideas an thoughts**

#saplings  **single nodes or thoughts**

#fruits      **new pieces of content**
