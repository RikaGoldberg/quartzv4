Welcome to my personal website where I share my notes üìî and my writing ‚úçÔ∏è.

I write about cryptocurrency. My writing focuses primarily on (1) organizational management -- how people coordinate to achieve goals -- and (2) on decentralized finance -- how and why people are creating an alternative financial system.

Actively participating in the crypto ecosystem fuels my writing and gives it substance. That's why I am on the governance team of 404 DAO, an organization that is a delegate to leading decentralized finance protocols including Uniswap, Arbitrum, Optimism, and DyDx. 

If you are here to read my published writing, here are some of my favorite pieces:

- [Managing Uncertainty in DAOs](https://www.newsletter.rikagoldberg.xyz/p/64-managing-uncertainty-in-daos-timeless)
- [Real Humans Need to Shape DAOs so They Don't Become a Rich Kids Club](https://beincrypto.com/real-humans-need-to-shape-daos-so-they-dont-become-a-rich-kid-club/)

The rest of my website serves as a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), a space where I think and take notes before publishing long-form content. It also doubles as a notes repository to help me jumpstart projects.
