Welcome to my personal website and [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought). 

I write about cryptocurrency, with a focus on Ethereum. My writing philosophy is two-pronged: (1) to write content that I myself would want to read; and (2) to write with vulnerability. I strive for my writing to challenge myself and my readers to think deeper. 

With that said, I write a lot about decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). #published âœ¨

I also write a newsletter called [Sharing is Caring](https://paragraph.xyz/@sharingiscaring) where I break down Ethereum protocols and products. And I have a newsletter on [Substack](https://www.newsletter.rikagoldberg.xyz/) which I no longer maintain but it has a lot of my early writing. 

Aside from writing, I'm on the governance team of [404 DAO](https://404-dao.notion.site/404-DAO-Governance-519af67dccd84df7b1d9dc50312fd813), an organization that is a delegate to leading decentralized finance protocols including Uniswap, Arbitrum, Optimism, and DyDx. We help to govern multi-billion dollar treasuries and make decisions that impact the longevity and sustainability of cornerstone Ethereum infrastructure, so we take our job seriously -- but we also like to have fun!
