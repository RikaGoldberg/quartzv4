Welcome to my personal website where I share my informal notes and my polished writing. You can find my notes in the digital garden section below and my polished writing in [[Published Writing]]

I write about cryptocurrency. My writing focuses primarily on (1) organizational management -- exploring crypto's new organizational structures -- and (2) on decentralized finance -- exploring crypto's alternative financial system. 

To fuel my writing and give it substance, I'm on the governance team of 404 DAO, an organization that is a delegate to leading decentralized finance protocols including Uniswap, Arbitrum, Optimism, and DyDx. 

The rest of my website serves as a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), a space where I think and take notes before publishing long-form content. It also doubles as a notes repository to help me jumpstart projects. Sprinkled in the garden, are some random notes, such as #recipes and #debug
