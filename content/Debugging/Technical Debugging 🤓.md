#debug 

One of my (probably) neurotic traits is to wrangle with technology for just a tad too long. When something technical is not working, I can go into a hyper focused mode that blocks my ability to see the bigger picture. Then, my energy gets zapped. Although I do eventually solve the problem, I don't *feel good.* When a similar problem happens again, I tend to go through the same pattern. 

So I finally decided to keep a little section in my notes for "technical thingies" that keep happening over and over again. I know that others experience the same problem so hopefully this dedicated space will also help you to debug your problem faster.
