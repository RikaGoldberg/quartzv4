This is not necessary technical debugging, but.. for some reason, I get tripped up from time to time with Amex statements. I think its how the statements are itemized. 

The New Charges line item does not include refunds/credits so, for example, if I make a lot of of returns in a particular month, New Charges will not show the refunds. Instead, returns are included in the payments/credits line item.
