#summary
Social networks are due for a disruption, but existing powerhouses like Facebook are entrenched because they have data on users, and [[data]], these days, is king. A new social network has to build deep belonging through a [[content/content/brand community]]and it needs activation energy from AR and VR. A decentralized [[content/content/brand economy]] means creating a marketplace for the [[content/content/brand]]'s assets. 

#notes 
Easy flow of information fueled mass adoption of the Internet. If finance was a prereq for the use of Internet apps, the Internet would have not taken off because that is too much friction. Thus, andreas argues that deFi will not drive blockchain adoption . 

Blockchain offers the flow of value.

This paper presents the concept of **“decentralized brand economies”** for the first time and demonstrates **how blockchain technology can be leveraged to build an experiential engagement infrastructure**. **It outlines the set of core principles a brand should follow to deliver value aligned with the needs of Gen Y, Z, and Alpha, and gives a practical implementation approach for a blockchain-based brand community engagement platform.**

A decentralized brand economy is a combination of two elements: **brand communities and decentralized marketplaces for brand-related assets**. **A brand community is a global group of people who love a brand and its purpose and have organized themselves around one or more aspects of a brand — social advocacy, special products, brand representatives, special brand stories.** A decentralized marketplace is the digital version of an old-style weekend market where people are free to peddle their different fairs without a central market manager. In combination, when brand communities leverage distributed ledger technology to create a decentralized marketplace, it is called a “decentralized brand economy.”

**If blockchain is to become the new global fabric for value exchanges and thus value democratization,** **it is imperative to find a path to rapid mass adoption.** How do we get 1 billion+ people utilizing blockchain in their daily lives?  Let’s be inspired by history—recent history.

Looking back on internet mass adoption the following three things happened before mass adoption could occur:

**Interoperability**
Through a common data exchange protocol: the TCP/IP network data exchange protocol was forced into mass adoption through the roll-out of Windows 95 by Microsoft.
**Easy Navigation**
Users could easily find and access information and apps through Google Search.
**Hyper-Productivity**
An easy to use killer app that increased productivity (Email) through abundant online services such as AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, and later Gmail.

The internet era killer apps targeted productivity and were end-consumer focused. They achieved greater simplicity, faster delivery, and rapid work replication, e.g., sending one email to many people at once. An important observation for us here is that the focus of those apps was information exchange, not value exchange.

Why? 

**Because apps with a non-financial focus significantly simplify adoption. Imagine if Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks by banks were required for everyone before being able to write an email.**
We are a far cry from the late 90s.  **Everything social has taken over as the main driver of the adoption of new technologies and overall societal change. Gen Y and Gen Z**—the most relevant generations for mass adoption today—have different demands, mainly community, sharing, and having meaningful experiences. These needs are starkly different from the generational needs that drove internet adoption.

**Going forward, the successors of Gen Y and Gen Z, such as Gen Alpha, will only know embedded mobile and ubiquitous connectivity to everyone and everything.** The unprecedented generational differences between Gen Y, Z, and Gen Alpha, and Gen X drive radical changes in online experiences. **Solutions seeking mass adoption must offer an engaging digital community, sharing, and purposeful experiences from anywhere, at any time on any device.**

Another fundamental difference is the rate of change we are experiencing today. **The pace of technological advancements preceding and including Gen X was measured in decades—we now measure technological change in years, if not months. The running joke is that one year in the blockchain sector is like ten normal years.** **Mindsets must quickly shift to manage this rapid, exponential change.** This is an enormous undertaking, **as evolution has optimized humans to be good at managing linear change, not exponential.** 

Consequently, humans are highly challenged to both recognize and manage exponential change. We typically miscalculate and do not adequately prepare for and adapt to fundamental change. **Yet, despite our exponential change curve, social as an exponential innovation engine has stalled.** **No considerably large, trendsetting, social network, or any other type of network has emerged since 2011.** T**he sole exception is China’s TikTok, which was founded in 2017.** Figure 1 displays the largest social media platforms as of January 2019.  Most companies in Figure 1 were established between 2000 and 2011. 

**The reality is that social media and e-commerce giants such as Facebook and Amazon are firmly entrenched, generating huge revenues through rent-seeking on the “new oil of the digital economy.” Data.** 

**The Net-Net of all of this? Given where we are right now as a species, both psychologically and technologically, new, truly disruptive innovations will have not only to target things people utilize daily to deliver value, but also provide hyper-productivity and an experiential community while having little adoption friction.** And even then, these innovations need to be self-disruptive, if not by design then by intent, to stay relevant and keep up with the exponential change curve.

There is a reason why the internet did not start with financial use cases. The tethering of use cases into regulatory frameworks that are not designed for user experience, community, and ease of use does not lend itself to rapid mass adoption.

Challenging the supremacy of banks and nation-states by trying to disrupt financial assets—their power base—begs the question if they will roll-over to the power of decentralization or will they fight tooth-and-nail to maintain their power? The two likely outcomes are that companies promoting DeFi will either be co-opted (bought-out), or they will be taken out by any means necessary.
**DeFi will potentially be a fast follower in blockchain mass adoption, but not a leader. So, if not DeFi, then who?**

Based on our insights from the internet age and brand communities above, **we predict that truly viral blockchain applications must target the daily activities of Gen Y and Gen Z, offer frictionless onboarding, hyper-productivity, and a vibrant, experiential community that brings a sense of belonging.** Our insights also indicate that these viral applications will likely emerge around brands, be it companies or individuals, that engage their followers on a personal level.

**Engagement is about activation, and blockchain by itself is not a great activation technology. However, it is an excellent incentivization technology.** **A brand would, therefore, need to combine blockchain technology with an activation-friendly technology such as AR/VR, and audio combined with Machine Learning/AI to create an experiential end-consumer focused platform.**
