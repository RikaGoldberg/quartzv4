Token airdrop set precedent for other exchanges to copy

Every version of uniswap has led innovation for other protocols

Untapped potential that v4 unlocks e.g, fee switch, treasury management 

Sets precedent for governance - immutable contracts, owned by DAO, real DAO

Bring CeFi into DeFi

An asset needs to be able to be swapped and represented. Price, liquidity. 

Uniswap represents core philosophies to the space. Once protocol is deployed, you can't change it. Only thru governance

Interesting things from delegates:

Token airdrop left Erin in a leadership vacuum when he was at Avantgarde. He's heard this from other delegates who feel this too. What does delegate do? How does delegate contribute? 

Purpose is to cut thru ambiguity. 

Fee switch would not make sense. 
Business model
Common liquidity pools. ETH/USDC more
Uniswap Credit Faciilty - deposit tokens and use them as the other side of the pair. 

Withdraw fees & swap fees are embedded into the protocol

**Protocol fee controller contract*

**What are the use cases for hooks?**
- coprocessors
- can passive liquidity be made more advantageous; how?
	- how can lps compete with professional market makers
- instead of building a new dex, build it with hooks. smaller dexs have reached out. 
- how can protocols & apps make money with hooks
	- want to see new businesses from hooks drive liquidity to uniswap protocol

v4 & solvers (make sure pool is not malicious?)

What is north star? Volume or liquidity or # of developers?
