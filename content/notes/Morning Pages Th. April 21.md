Here we go. Random shit come out of my head. 

Last night, mike and i went to starry pub, a revolutionary meeting space, to hear from local poets at a poetry slam. It was really low lift. We judged. The bar opened after being closed since covid, but around since 1973. 

I'm working to write stuff for my newsletter every day. Few people are liking it, but who cares? It's not about external rewards. 

What do I want to write about today? Unfinished drafts..
