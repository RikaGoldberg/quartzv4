I have a love-hate relationship with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger because they are hostile towards cryptocurrency. However, as Morgan Housel would say, it make sense given their unique life experience that brought them great wealth. It was through value investing, buying and holding stocks with solid fundamentals, strong earnings power, and the potential for long-term growth, that they made their fortune. 

Interestingly, I would argue that bitcoin and Ethereum are good value assets, hence the HODL meme that encourages people to buy and hold. I don't agree with the subculture around the meme, that encourages buying lavish, ostentatious items
