### Highlights

Rather than “inventing” organizational governance, the opportunity here is to apply existing frameworks that adopt a computer-aided governance approach to create more resilient, self-governing organizations.

In a recent working paper, we argue that decentralized technology communities are already practicing cybernetic principles without knowing it. The VSM is relevant to decentralized modes of self-organization as the goal is functional autonomy, which can enable a form of collective autonomy.

Stafford Beer articulated the “Viable System Model” (VSM) in his 1972 book ‘Brain of the Firm’ as a management tool to determine the viability of an organization. Applying the VSM is about structuring resilience in an organization — to adapt to changes in environment (variety) and survive, in line with its purpose.
