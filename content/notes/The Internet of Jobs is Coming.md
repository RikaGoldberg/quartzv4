The Internet of Jobs (IoJ) is what happens when web3 collides with the timeless exchange of labor for money in the digital realm. It creates a new and improved labor marketplace that integrates value transfer as a native feature, allowing our relationship with labor to be peer-to-peer and less reliant on central intermediaries with unilateral control.

ICOs, NFTs, and DeFi are all major use cases for blockchains that have already been proven. They have created a multi-billion dollar marketplace for their products, and the emergent industry around these 3 use cases has created a class of knowledge workers who are crypto-native and paid in crypto.

Many crypto projects have elected to organize themselves as DAOs – internet native organizations. Because these new digital organizations employ many crypto-natives, DAOs are the catalyst for the internet of jobs.

The TAM (total addressable market) for the internet of jobs is massive. There are over 7 billion people in the world, and many of them would like to earn an income.

For 99% of the world, their financial lives are their jobs - not their investments. For this reason, I predict that Web3 won’t go mainstream until the internet of jobs is mainstream.

Skeuomorphism is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them.

Whenever there is a new category of computing, the first products are usually _Skeuomorphic_.

A common misconception is that the IoJ will be like the gig economy. It is true that gig sites like UpWork, Fiver, Uber, and others have been hallmark web2 marketplaces.

But they have been limited because they have shimmed onto the old financial system + the old internet. Without Ethereum providing easy tools to make such marketplaces transparent, immutable, global, or governable by their communities, the design space was much more limited.

Many important attributes will be unbundled from our legacy employment infrastructure & rebundled into the IoJ

Let’s get into the fun part: Designing mechanisms for an IoJ native world. Here is a generalized function of how ALL internet of jobs-era projects work:

> _token emission = f(time, materials, skills, work output, … other signals)_

Read in plain English, the tokens you earn are the results of f(inputs) where inputs are the time, materials, skills, the value of the work output you create.

Of course it would be foolish to believe that you can boil down all this down to just money. There are many other implications on human welfare, and they will be explored as well. So really, the formula for the IoJ is not just

> _token emission = f(time, materials, skills, output, other signals)_

Taking into account these things, we could restate the formula as

> _token emission + reputation + learning + impact = f(time, materials, skills, output, other signals)_

My present personal view is that the true endgame for the IoJ is to build a world that is abundant in each of the individual [eight circuits of human consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-circuit_model_of_consciousness) for as many people as possible for as long as possible.

I’d like to believe we are designing a regenerative internet of value for the thriving of a global citizenry, an aggregation of 3-dimensional humans, each with differing values, ambitions, backgrounds, geographies, psychological orientations, financial endowments, privilege levels, abilities, and physical archetypes. We celebrate our diversity but also recognize our common human needs to live in healthy ecosystems, attain economic empowerment and maintain individual sovereignty.

I’d like to believe this. Maybe if other people would too, we can achieve a consensus on that north star and build it together.
