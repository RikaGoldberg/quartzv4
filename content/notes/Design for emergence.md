The backstory of emergence is complicated. It can't be boiled down simply and cleanly. We need to dig in, dive deep, share stories of emergence. 

Emergence is as natural to living beings as breathing. 
- When we breath, we do without doing. Emergence is also do without doing. Instead of creating rigid walls and structure, you just build a foundation. You set up camp and then dissasemble camp. Pitch a tent and then disassemble it. 

Emergence is when structures in a system form on their own. When they are co-created by actors in the system. Not imposed by top down rules. 

Emergence is a systems principle that has been studied by theorists, computer scientists, business people, leaders, innovators. 

If you want to build a long-lasting system -- a technology protocol with an ecosystem of applications -- or a voting system -- or a reputation system -- or a family unit -- emergence is key. 

I will focus on technology because that's what I know most about right now. 

Relationships need to be coded into the technology protocol. A platform, the Internet browser or an application like Pinterest, is useless without users. 

Focusing on user needs, and really thinking about what the purpose and the impact of the platform is, is critical for long-term success. 

An old way of focusing on user needs was to survey and interview. This puts the designer of the protocol in control. 

The next evolution of user centered design is putting the users in control. Allowing them to build and play, like Hypercard. 

The Internet browser is useless without new features. A heavy browser like Firefox allows developers to play and build, but it's too feature rich. 

It doesn't make sense to keep building new features. It's a drain of a company's resources, so instead have developers build and ship stuff. But you need a filter mechanism otherwise you become like Firefox. 

In humans, the filter mechanism is natural selection. The best features win. So people who are assholes procreate but then its up to the women to epigenetically eliminate the asshole gene through nurture. It takes a village to help do this. 

Composability is like LEGOS, where you try new things and adapt your design based on needs. You are given the core foundational components, the blocks. Then, with your personal creativity, you can design whatever you want. 

Emergence requires self-organization. People need to be autonomous and independent. At the beginning, it may be difficult, but people need to learn for themselves and not have their hand held. 

As an organization changes (management approaches change) --as a technology protocol changes -- the established practices may no longer work.
