>**Adler distinguished between striving for power and striving for mastery and overcoming obstacles. He argued that both offer ways of satisfying our “striving for perfection” but that the mastery drive is more about overcoming one’s personal challenges than wielding power over others.

DAOs will often invent their own terminology because the term to describe what they’re doing doesn’t yet exist in our lexicon. Remember, DAOs are building new systems, so they’re also shaping language. To understand their language, means you need to do some deciphering and I have a technique that works well.

The technique is simple, but hard in practice. It requires us to cultivate a beginner’s mind. We do this by breaking down complex ideas into their component parts. We lay out the foundation, like a total beginner, and then keep asking ourselves “why” and “what” questions. 

**How do you know when to stop asking yourself “why” and “what” questions?**

[Infinite regress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress) is the principle that beliefs are layered on one another. Once you uncover one belief, you discover another belief that justifies the first belief, and so and so forth. Beliefs are like turtles stacked on top of each other. You can go on till infinity like this, but with enough practice, you develop an intuition and know when it’s sufficient to stop.**

This principle is a practice, not a solution. Practice enough times and, one day, you will become a master.**

## MetaFactory Case Study
We can practice infinite regress, asking ourselves “why” and “what” questions, to understand MetaFactory’s mission. 

MetaFactory’s mission is to become a decentralized brand. 

What is a decentralized brand? 

Surprisingly, there is no page for ‘decentralized brand' on Wikipedia.

The term is brand new.

So let’s build it up from its foundation, using a reductionist approach to define each of the words, separately, and then put them  back together to form a holistic definition of a decentralized brand.

Define brand:

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand), “a brand is a name, term, design, or symbol, that distinguishes one seller’s goods or services from those of other sellers.”

Define decentralized: 

[According to Wikipedia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) decentralization is “the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.”

Put the two terms together: a decentralized brand is a unique name, term, design, or symbol that is neither planned by a central authoritative group, nor are decisions made by a central authoritative group.

This is a good start. 

Why is a brand valuable?

Look at the history.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand), the practice of branding has roots that go all the way back to the Egyptians in 2,700 BCE.

>The practice of branding - in the original literal sense of marking by burning - is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.


Why are people today paying a lot of money for a brand?

[High fashion aficionados](https://www.insider.com/guides/style/how-to-buy-a-birkin-bag) are willing to pay upwards of ten thousand dollars for a Birkin bag. The value of the bag goes up over time, so it’s not only an accessory, but also an investment. 
  
[Gen Z, Gen X, and Gen Alpha](https://consensys.net/blog/enterprise-blockchain/decentralized-brand-economies-the-key-to-blockchain-mass-adoption/) are willing to shell out thousands of dollars for limited edition streetwear like t-shirts and sneakers. 

As MetaFactory writes, [people are eager to spend bookoo money on brands primarily to show that they are part of a subculture](https://themetafactory.medium.com/metafactory-rearchitecting-culture-for-the-digital-metaverse-df2693b7ec3b). Birkin bags are not available on demand at stores. If you want to buy a Birkin bag, you need to know how. And legit streetwear brands aren’t just available at the store, either. You need to know how to acquire them, via a drop on a website, a physical store, or a resale platform. 

People who are willing to pay the money also have an eye for quality. As Avery Booker, the CEO of Enflux, a data-tech company that helps companies predict trends and consumer behavior, [says about the drop culture](https://bbc.com/worklife/article/20180205-the-hype-machine-streetwear-and-the-business-of-scarcity): 

>The younger customer is already well tuned into it. They have a unique eye, they know what they can resell, and they know many brands. I think they are very discerning customers in a way, which is fascinating.”

Brands are extremely valuable in society. Their value can be traced back to the Egyptians in 2,700 BCE. Brands are not only fashion statements, but also investments, and entrypoints to a subculture.

My research took me to two more key terms: brand community and brand economy. 

Brand community is, [according to Dialogue](https://www.archantdialogue.co.uk/blog/how-to-create-a-brand-community-set-up-and-success) (a company that helps brands craft their strategy) is a group of like-minded people who form an attachment to a brand or product.

Brand economy, which we have not yet touched on, is according to me (a person who has interacted with brand economies) a marketplace where a brand’s assets can be bought and sold. 

Finally, with all of the key terms defined, and answers to a few “why” questions, I have a definition for decentralized brand (remember, MetaFactory’s mission is to become a decentralized brand): 

A decentralized brand is an apparel marketplace that sells dope products deeply valued by a community of loyal followers. The community makes decisions about which products are sold and the direction of the marketplace, without managerial oversight or a central approval authority.

MetaFactory is already making moves to decentralize with an initiative called The Curation Game. 

[The Curation Game](https://twitter.com/TheMetaFactory/status/1347218505108656128?s=20&t=eZ121ANHo1VmhfAum_QN8Q) will give members decision making power over which designs go into production. Members will act like curators, staking Robot on the designs they want to see produced, and then get rewarded based on a proportional amount of the design’s sales.**
