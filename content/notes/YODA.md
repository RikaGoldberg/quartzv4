YODA is a DAO Anthology Series that I am writing. Perhaps it will one day become a printed book. 

## Short Story #1: MetaCartel DAO

### Summary ✨
This is my first short story in an anthology of short stories, a book, about DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). This first short story memes its way into existence, following the journey of MetaCartel DAO, the second DAO to ever exist.

## Short Story #2: MetaFactory DAO

### Summary ✨
This is my second short story in an anthology of short stories, a book, about DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). This second short story develops a set of principles called the [DAO Wei](/notes/DAO%20Wei.md) to help DAO contributors navigate through the choppy waters of DAO. I use [MetaFactory](/notes/MetaFactory.md) as a case study for the [DAO Wei](/notes/DAO%20Wei.md)
