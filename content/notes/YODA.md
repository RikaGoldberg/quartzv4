## What is this? ‚ÅâÔ∏è
YODA is a long-term writing project that I am working on. The objective is to write positive narratives about [DAOs](/notes/DAO.md) in the [MetaCartel](/notes/MetaCartel%20DAO.md) family. 

I use the word "family." Is MetaCartel a mafia? LOL. Not really, maybe? No, I don't think so...

Is a MetaCartel a cult? Ha-ha! No..I don't think so. Unlike a cult, I am free to join and write about whatever DAOs I like. I am free to intake whatever information I want. 

I do feel that MetaCartel has my back...just like a functional family. 

MetaCartel is building a family-friendly community and I love being a part of it. It truly feels like MetaCartel members are building something bigger than ourselves, and that is awe-inspring! 

If you are interested in learning more, or joining the family, [holler at me](https://twitter.com/RikaGoldberg) ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Summary ‚ú®
This is my second short story in an anthology of short stories, a book, about DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). This second short story develops a set of principles called the [DAO Wei](/notes/DAO%20Wei.md) to help DAO contributors navigate through the choppy waters of DAO. I use [MetaFactory](/notes/MetaFactory.md) as a case study for the [DAO Wei](/notes/DAO%20Wei.md)
