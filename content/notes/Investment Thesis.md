Investors, such as venture capitalists and angels, have an investment thesis that helps them to make sound investment decisions. 

Consistency is key to successful investing. **It's important to stick to a plan**. This is **a system, with a schedule, that automates the making of investment decisions, which helps reduce the anxiety around the psychological struggle of investing**, notably the unpredictably and uncertainty of the stock market. 

Independent parts in an investment management system work together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. The system consists of the following parts: 
1. Budget - a granular, line-by-line tracking of cash inflow and outflow. Features of a budget:
	- estimate of future cash inflow & outflow (based on spending data)
	- actual cash inflow & outflow
	- ability to set time-bound goals (including milestones, required savings amount, an end date)
	-Purpose of budget: To make sure you're not overspending so you can reach financial goals
2. **Savings Account with Bank**
	6 months of expenses in emergency fund (savings)
3. Investments 
	-Purpose of investments: to make your money make money. 
	-**Investment income** can be withdrawn to **fund goals**, especially if paycheck doesn't cover expenses, as in my situation. 
1. Forecast - expected future outflows 

**Tools**:

**Outstanding Questions**
- What are the risks of staking ETH?

	Staking Ethereum natively requires 32 ETH as collateral and technical knowledge and hardware. Liquid staking protocols like LIDO create tokenized assets to represent staked ETH. Seems like this is more risky (in its own way) than natively staking ETH because you need to trust the protocol. LIDo is taking other people's money to run validator nodes and then creating wrapped tokens to represent an interest in this staked ETH. So they're financializing staking ETH. I think from a risk perspective, using LIDO to earn staking rewards creates more risk in your portfolio
