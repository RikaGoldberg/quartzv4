VCs, angels, etc. have investment thesis. This helps them articulate what and why to invest in. It helps with accountability and consistency. 

Historically, my investment thesis has been to invest in tokens with utility. Not for trading, but long-term tokens that I believe in and that I think will go up in value, over the long-term. 

It's the Warren Buffett approach. Invest in Campbells Soup type of stable, boring stocks. 

In crypto, it's called HODL. 

Well, I'm tired of HODLing because I feel FOMO. It's deeper than just feeling like I didn't make a bunch of bank like other people by trading crypto. 

I feel like I'm not learning. In crypto, to earn you have to play. I feel like I'm not playing. I feel like I'm sitting on the sidelines. It stems from a fear of failure. Of it being hard. Of losing money. 

Trading is psychological. That's why poker players make good traders

Said differently, what investing system do I want to create?
