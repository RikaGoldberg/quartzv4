-- Hbesso31 wrote a solid overview in [forum post on MetaGame and Urbanika](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/metagame-and-urbanika-a-powerful-use-case/1110?u=hbesso31)

-   **MyMeta**, a social media platform where users can create web3 personal profiles and connect with others who share the same interests,
-   **ChievMint**, an NFT minter that celebrates people’s successes,
-   **QuestChains**, a place where users can find and commit to completing challenges in exchange for a certificate that attests to their achievement, and
-   **Dashboard** a personalized panel from a DAO that shows the most recent news, social media posts, and videos, as well as a leaderboard that ranks users by the experience points (XP) they have earned for contributing to the DAO in regard.  
    -**MetaSys**, a gamified accounting contribution system that turns actions into XP and then to token allocation.

In addition to education and onboarding, we are also building a user interface for [decentralized identity](/notes/Decentralized%20Identity.md) and [Web3 reputation](/notes/Web3%20reputation.md) ...

✅ Built our first product: [MyMeta Profiles](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/what-we-do/mymeta)

✅ Built a minimum viable platform: [MetaOS](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/what-we-do/metaos)

✅ Built the [onboarding game & decentralized courses](https://metagame.substack.com/p/122-both-quest-chains-and-the-onboarding)

✅ Published a bunch of [educational content](https://metagame.wtf/learn/thegreathouses/house-of-daos) & [podcast episodes](https://anchor.fm/MetaGame/)

✅ Organized events like this [conference](https://metagame.substack.com/p/intercon-what-how-even), [hackathon](https://metagame.substack.com/p/fork-the-world-hackathon), [a festival](https://metagame.substack.com/p/meta-47-wait-wtf-is-a-metafest-), [second edition of it](https://metagame.substack.com/p/metafest2-is-happening-now) & now organizing [the third](https://metafest.wtf/)

✅ Fostered an awesome community & a small network of projects

✅ Helped people level up & break into the DAO ecosystem

✅ Made sure everything we do is fully open-source

Our long term vision is to build a general purpose coordination game for helping people level up, find others & solve real-world problems. A decentralized society built around well-being and impact maximization
