## Highlights
He believed that cybernetics (what he called “the science of effective organization”) represented a new frontier in institutional and organizational design, a powerful tool that would inevitably be taken up if not by the forces of democracy and freedom then by their enemies, authoritarians of either the corporate or government variety (if not both).

The “electronic mafia” is an evocative and not entirely inaccurate description of current tech company executives and the venture capitalists that fund them.

Their enforcement techniques are more subtle than broken kneecaps and concrete shoes, but nonetheless, in a relative blink of an eye, it has become nearly impossible for most people to live a normal life without paying a kind of protection money in the form of consenting to the control technologies of surveillance, algorithmic feeds, real-name profiles and the like.

“Technology is neither good nor evil, nor is it neutral,” the saying goes, but if the only people successfully dictating how to make use of it are evil, well, it’s not hard to see how that plays out.

A better debate is how we should decide to use communications technology. Rather than accept the status quo — where online behavior is funneled into easily manageable forms to be better captured by a handful of firms — can new social arrangements accommodate what the internet makes possible? Can they enhance human freedom rather than curtail it?

Instead, what matters to Beer is the relationships between different layers of a system: whether the actors at each level have appropriate, timely information from below and above, and the extent to which they are empowered to act. In other words, both capitalist and state socialist organizations can fail by reducing their human agents to mere machines, preventing the flow of information necessary to adapt to a complex and continually changing world.

During the Cold War, Western discussion of this topic was generally preoccupied by the grand debates between capitalism and communism, but the British military was still run on command-and-control principles. The key challenge it faced was timely information flow from the periphery to the command center so that it could effectively distribute resources and manpower across its sphere of engagement.

But Beer is perhaps most famous for orchestrating the Chilean economic experiment under socialist president Salvador Allende: Project Cybersyn, the effort to establish an electronic “nervous system” that could rapidly incorporate economic information from across the vast distances of Chilean geography. The goal was to enable economic planning without the informational gaps and ruinous time lags that had hampered Soviet-style organization.

For example, say a snowstorm destroys a factory: that means a shortage of machine tools, which delays tractor repairs, which causes a wheat shortage. A market economy (as Hayek famously argues in “The Use of Knowledge in Society”) uses prices to transmit and process the information that addresses this problem (the machine tools become more expensive, so other producers start to make more of it in order to make more money, addressing the problem “locally”), but a command economy requires all this information to somehow filter up to be processed by the center.

In a strict command system (either corporate or government), most workers are reduced to using only a fraction of their human capacities: The division of labor means restricting the scope of action. So we have the overnight security guard who contributes only their eyes to the regulation of society, or the call-center employee who can only use their voice, restricted to a tightly specified set of options.

Each of these people, Beer argues, is a complex system capable of an incredible range of information reception, mental processing, and physical action — not to mention specifically human qualities like empathy, creativity, and spontaneity — but the existing economic system ignores those capacities in favor of rendering the complicated and unpredictable world legible to the inefficiently designed organizations that run things.

From today’s vantage point, the language of cybernetics in the previous paragraph — humans understood as “complex systems” and in terms of “capacities” for society’s “regulation” — may appear unusual.

But from about 1950 to the mid-1970s, it was influential among both intellectuals and the general public. Norbert Wiener, the mathematician who coined the term cybernetics in his 1948 book of the same name, was then something of a household name. For Beer cybernetics was essential if human society were to be organized at the scale of something like the U.S. or Walmart, or even the British Army.

Rocketry provides a good analogy: There is a limit to how large and powerful liquid-fuel rockets can be because each additional booster stage adds more weight for the rest of the boosters to lift.

There is a fundamental trade-off between objective, transparent rules and an adversarial population of this size pursuing a range of radically disparate goals.

Beer’s work sought to address and mitigate that trade-off, in search of systems that could be scaled up without generating even bigger problems.

For instance, McDonald’s can produce massive quantities of a very small variety of foods, but with less ability to improvise than an average short-order cook; FDA bureaucratic systems can verify the safety of new medicines but cannot react quickly to rapidly changing threats.

So each human, unlike a bee in a hive or an ant in its anthill, is both a unique individual and a contributor to a robust society. Where the individual ant is essentially worthless and only the collective of ants really counts as an organism, humans and their society are co-equal and intertwined.

This is important because it establishes that human beings, in all our exquisite variety, are the ultimate source of complexity.

In a centralized bureaucracy, the electrician can spot an obvious problem with the plumbing that will flood the entire building and shrug: not my problem

In decentralized neoliberal precarity, the electrician can shut off electricity for non-payment, spoiling the food and rendering the family unable to work their way out of debt and shrug: not my problem. In both cases, the electrician is prevented from adopting a regulatory role, from making local adjustments that would ultimately help the system function better.

Beer’s early work saw big gains from allowing factory workers more opportunity to mingle casually and keep each other abreast of goings-on in different parts of the shop rather than kicking every problem up the command chain and requiring a centralized solution. To scale throughout society, though, some message about the problem and solution should be circulated: If many buildings are facing the same problem, a sectoral manager could take note and figure out what is causing this trend, perhaps some materials shortage facing plumbers.

When it comes to the internet, many of us have adopted a pose of helplessness or indifference. Disempowered from fixing obvious problems like the dozens of entities tracking our behavior or the ads we have to see to conduct standard professional networking, we have outsourced the responsibility to centralized actors. “Whoever opts out of his or her regulatory role is robbing the total system of its power to be stable,” Beer argues.

“We have robbed society of regulatory variety by our passivity.” The electronic mafia who have been pushing the “magnificent bribe” of convenience for technological dependency are more than happy to encourage that passivity. They’d like us all to spend our time buying things and consuming media. Beer would argue that it is key to stop doing that, and instead to take an active role in the regulation of the system.

There are, of course, already Twitter communities, Facebook groups, YouTube fan bases, but these are organized according to platform logic: ferocious competition for fast-twitch attention, with the goal of maximum audience segmentation to better target ads. These organizations are capable of coordinated online action (just go on Twitter and make fun of BTS), but platform affordances make sustained action and tactical diversity nearly impossible.

But some online communities — artist collectives, political activists, nerdy friend groups  — are experimenting with new technological and social possibilities like private Discords and DAOs to address longstanding collective action problems that plague organizations that try to scale up without explicit hierarchy.

Discord is one example of a platform where potentially large groups can break into smaller groups to discuss specific issues, to store information, and to flexibly devolve moderation with less risk of the context collapse and algorithmic attention gamification that happens on corporate platforms.

Similarly, a better society will not miraculously arise automatically through the processes of representative democracy. The only hope is to build it collectively through trial and error and the accumulated efforts of millions of wonderfully complex humans, rather than rolling out the welcome mat for the next generation of electronic mafia. Millions of young people around the world trying to build out alternative technological infrastructures seems like a better bet for improving the internet than voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. Our only hope is in our collective capacities to build and regulate a society empowered by modern communication technology. No one else is coming to save us.
