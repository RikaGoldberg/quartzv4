Top of Mind today: 

- Burn Out. Has touched me personally and my family and friends
- Compassion vs. impulse. Which one will win? lol. 
- Writing stories about long-term thinking. Kat said an example of when to think short-term and when to think long-term. She said maybe it's like marriage when you're placing a bet that someone will be there to support you in the long term. 

For my own mental health, I need to take a break now. I can feel myself on my computer for too long. 

Tomorrow, I need to spend some time in my digital garden. 
Forbes article metafactory. V interesting. Chill with Anise tomorrow.
