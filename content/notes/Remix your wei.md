> Cognitive exploration - which can be defined as a general curiosity about information and a tendency toward complexity and flexibility in information processing - enables us to be curious about confusing situations, increasing the likelihood that we will find new meaning in the seemingly incomprehensible.

The possibilities for a DJ to create a remix are endless. There are as many possible variations of a song as there are humans in the world. If you have ever used a music production software, you know that there are thousands of ways to morph and shape a sound. It’s all very confusing as a beginner.

So how does a DJ do it?

The answer lies in nature. Remember the ants from Principle #1? They know what to do by relying on their intuition. Unlike humans, they never question their intuition. And when a DJ makes a song, she also must trust her intuition. This takes practice, of course, to develop a sense of personal taste and style. But once a DJ has done so, songs start to click, and then it’s banger after banger

When you first join a DAO, the confusion is real. Tons of Discord channels, forums, and one-off conversations. It seems like chaos. But don’t quit. You can find a wei to make meaning in the complexity by practicing curiosity.

You can do the “why” exercise from Principle #2 and you can also use the chaos as a shaping ground for your own unique ideas.

How do you do this?

You get curious. You listen to what types of conversations draw you in and what topics make your ears perk. Is it community? Is it governance? Is it crypto economics? Is it systems design? Something else? Whatever it is, listen to your curiosity.

Eventually, you will find the cross section between your interests and skills and what the DAO needs.

## MetaFactory Case Study
The principle of ‘remix your we’i can best be demonstrated by MetaFactory’s origin story. 

MetaFactory first started as Swag DAO, an apparel platform for crypto swag. [Drew Harding](https://twitter.com/DrewHarding) had the idea during Devcon, an Ethereum conference, in Osaka, Japan. SwagDAO was the first attempt at transforming crypto culture with fashion.

TLDR; Drew wanted to spice up swag that companies gave away at crypto conferences. He envisioned an auction system where two t-shirt designs would be auctioned at the same time, but only one design would win. Bidders who bid on the winning design, only pay Cost of Goods Sold, subsidizing the losing bidders who must pay full price, MSRP, for the shirts. The auction would be live for 30 days, with the swag price dropping over time in line with a continuous token bonding curve (note: [a continuous token bonding curve](https://medium.com/coinmonks/token-bonding-curves-explained-7a9332198e0e) is a smart contract that creates its own market for tokens without relying on exchanges). 

I know this sounds complicated, and it is, but if anyone could pull it off, it’s definitely Drew. 

Why?

Because Drew was a student of the wei. 

As a founding member of MetaCartel, he carefully observed emerging governance structures and community approaches, figuring out how to best use his skills to build something that people needed.

Drew also has an insatiable curiosity to design systems, using crypto as a backdrop for experimenting with game theory.

And, he had a ton of experience, more than a decade, actually, building legacy mobile and web development products. [He ran two successful digital agencies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewharding/details/experience/). 

Of course, Drew could not build Swag DAO alone. He would need a lot of support, so to find ‘the others’, he designed a [branding competition](https://medium.com/metacartel/swagdao-design-competition-3848ba2750de) and this meme:

Drew was looking for people who were curious about game theory and cryptoeconomics, knew a thing or two about apparel and marketing, and had good design skills.

The winner of the competition was Hammad Jutt a.k.a. MetaDreamer. 

Hammad studied Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, mined bitcoin in the early days, built successful Internet businesses [for a fashion audience](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/nelo-university-alberta-fashion-hollywood-1.4474028), and was researching game theory and cryptoeconomics.

Hammad’s submission was clever and fun. He also proposed changing the brand name from Swag DAO to MetaFactory.

Note how the first image looks like a page from a coloring book, foreshadowing an idea that MetaFactory would turn into reality by producing a choose your own adventure sweatshirt [ready to decorate with markers](https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/choose-your-own-adventure-sweatshirt-bundle). 

  

You’ll find a lot of radical and weird ideas in DAOs that have been remixed from culture - books, music, and movies. The best way to learn is by choosing your own adventure. 

  

Here are some ideas to learn more:

  

-   If you’re interested in lottery games, learn about FOMO3D [here.](https://fomo3d.hostedwiki.co/pages/Fomo3D%20Explained) 
    

  

-   If you’re interested in curation mechanisms, like the curation game, you should go back to its origins, token curated lists, [here](https://medium.com/@simondlr/continuous-token-curated-registries-the-infinity-of-lists-69024c9eb70d) 
    

  

-   If you’re interested in fashion and subculture, you should know about [geeks, mopheads, and sociopaths.](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths) 
    

  
If you’re interested in the Metaverse, you should read cyberpunk like [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) and [Neuromancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6088007-neuromancer) and then read Solarpunk like [The Dispossessed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed).**
