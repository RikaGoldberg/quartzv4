Interview with [Matt Johnson](https://twitter.com/OmnistratMatt)

**What is Wildfire DAO?**

- [Fire Eyes DAO](/notes/Fire%20Eyes%20DAO.md) has reached institutional level – james waugh, callum gladstone, cooper turley, lucas campbell. On panels at lots of conferences. 

- Worked with many projects. Did token acquisitions so had to do meta governance that got too unwieldy. 

- Wildire is a services DAO. 

- Had an open invitation for genesis squad of core operators. 

- 1 of 16 core operators. 

- Structured under working groups. Infrastructure, creative, public goods, DeFi

**Tell me about public goods working group**

- ENS & Gitcoin. 

- Already have tokens. Agreement is to monitor the discussions and proposals and vote accordingly. Kind of like Fire Eyes delegating to Wildfire. 

- Consulting too. 

- Not command and control but Fire Eyes isn’t telling people how to vote. When going through proposals, figure out the problem and if the proposed solution is a good one. Sometimes create proposals too. 

- Most of the time it's intuition to understand how to vote. 

  - Some proposals get published to Mirror as community activities. 

- Were put into working groups out of the gate, not given much direction, so the peer operators within working groups got really tight. Spent a lot of time with weekly meetings and monitoring projects. Took time to meet with core teams in the projects. Lots of chats on Discord to stay in the loop and figure things out.  

- No prescriptive meetings with all working groups. Just recently started all working group wide meetings. Most people would visit other working groups channels and people are friendly so not an issue. Since then, added more structure and process. So now weekly calls for all the groups. 

- Fire eyes said, if they could do it again they wouldn’t start off with working groups. 

- At first, there were floaters. One person was in charge of building out Notion to capture work. The other one was writing up all the working group proposal activities to centralize doc. For weekly newsletter. 

- North Star from beginning was just to help the Ethereum ecosystem. 

- Core operators - 4 per working group. So all 4 were peers, flat. 

- Some operators move on. There is turnover. 

- Public goods has had 4 people turn over. Matt is the only constant in Genesis group. 

- People naturally stay in working groups without switching over. 

  **Should we not start off with working groups? Do you agree with Fire Eyes statement?

	- Add more emergence to form community rather than fire eyes dictating what to do. So a bottoms up approach vs. top down. Fire eyes hand selected working group operators.
