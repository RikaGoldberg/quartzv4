### Highlights
While political power within the organization may be more or less distributed depending on the mechanisms in place, **these organizations exhibit group-level (or ‘collective’) autonomy.** 

Blockchains enable novel forms of social organization, including “decentralized autonomous organizations” (DAOs), that offer experimentation into distributed, digital self-governance. Blockchain networks are comprised of geographically distributed computers (or “nodes”) [2]. **The aim is to “decentralize” power structures to reduce the reliance on central points of trust. People can participate as operators of the organization and by placing their trust the software encoded rules of the system.**

The phrase “decentralized autonomous organization” was originally used in the field of cybernetics to describe a complex, multi-agent “intelligent” system that could self-organize.

The term “DAO” first appeared in relation to blockchain technology in an article by Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin in Bitcoin Magazine in 2013 [4]. “What is a corporation?” asks Buterin, “it’s nothing more than people and contracts all the way down.” [4]. This conception of DAOs perpetuates the “cypherpunk” ideology of anarchic self-organization.

Scholars of blockchain networks define a DAO as “a blockchain-based system that enables people to coordinate and govern themselves mediated by a set of self-executing rules deployed on a public blockchain, and whose governance is decentralized (i.e. independent from central control)”.

DAOs have proliferated as a method of community organization in number, goals, and scale [6]. There is a need for conceptual frameworks and tools as to how to go about decentralized governance design and analysis that consider both the social and technical aspects of these organizations

Buterin was far from the first to pose the question “what is a corporation?” or to observe the recursive nature of such organizations. A deep and comparatively novel investigation occurs in the field of Organizational (or Management) Cybernetics pioneered by Stafford Beer, with the development of the Viable Systems Model, [7–9]. Taking cues from biology, a viable system is one which has sufficient adaptive capacity to survive in a changing, potentially adversarial, environment.

Cybernetics is not a scientific field so much as it is a research aesthetic for complex systems drawing on biology, engineering, and mathematics.

In the 1940s and 1950s, computer and information systems were just emerging and the pioneers of these fields necessarily worked outside of disciplinary boundaries. Many  research areas grew out of cybernetics and became disciplines of their own, such as artificial intelligence and control theory

Management Cybernetics fits into the modern field of Operations Research [12]. In this work, cybernetics is defined as transdisciplinary research focused on self-organizing systems within an aesthetic blending mathematically rigorous engineering methods and biomimicry.

Gabriel Shapiro, a prominent legal engineer in the DAO space takes a narrow definition of DAOs, emphasizing that autonomy and decentralization are spectra, and the term DAO should be reserved for those organizations pushing the boundaries in both dimensions

>>Even as early as in the 1967 second edition of Cybernetics and Management, he [Beer] wrote of the hard distinction between autonomy and centralised control that ‘the [cybernetic] model shows how naıve that dichotomy is as an organizational description. **No viable organism is either centralised or decentralized. It is both things at once, in different dimensions.**' -Beer, 1967

The vernacular of ‘viable systems’ as a mode of organization provides a way to express the elements of non-hierarchical organization, creating space for criticism of existing power relations while still pursuing a clear purpose. 

Without realizing it, decentralized technology communities are already practicing cybernetics [22]. By becoming aware of the cybernetics literature, it is possible to benefit from the existing within viable organizations capable of self-organization.

**The Viable System Model (VSM) is a representation of the organizing structure of an autonomous system which is capable of adapting to changes in its environment, in line with its purpose.**

**Autonomy in this context means that the system is self-governing.** The VSM is comprised of five systems which co-regulate the organization at different scales in time, and different spatial scales encompassing the various critical functions of the organization.

System 1: Primary Functions, or day-to-day activities conducted by constituent parts of the organization interacting with its environment.

System 2: Co-ordinating Functions, which align the day-to-day activities of System 1 with each other, its collective purpose.

System 3: Rules and other structures (such as software), which support the activities in System 1 and System 2.

System 4: Strategic Functions that look both outward and inward, to consider how internal systems might adapt to external changes.

System 5: Governance Functions that align the overall organization, defining or refining the goal(s), and resolve resource conflicts between the other systems.

 Beer compares this model to human decision-making by suggesting that Systems 1-3 are like the autonomic nervous system, System 4 is like cognition and conversation, and System 5 can be related to conscious reasoning and decision-making [9]

**An organization is viable in so far as it is able to survive a wide range of potential unknown changes to its environment (including emergence of adversaries).** In the cybernetics literature, the range of behaviors a system is capable of exhibiting is called “variety” [32]. The concept of “requisite variety” means that governance in a system has a wide enough range of behaviors to respond to a changing environment to survive and continue to fulfill its purpose.

**This adaptive capacity provides resilience in the sense that an organization which has been adversely affected by conditions outside its control can ‘bounce back’ by adapting itself to changes in environment and continue to fulfill its purpose [33]. The set of actions available to an organization which allow it to adapt itself is called the governance surface.**

To provide intuition for the governance surface, Figure 1 shows the various feedback loops within a DAO, and has been edited to denote the actions which exercise the governance surface.

Framing the governance surface as a control surface to be exercised pursuant to an organization’s purpose invites the question: **“who fills the role of controller of an organization?”** For DAOs, the answer to this question must be those that are considered members of the organization [37]. A canonical control system is defined in terms of a logically centralized decision making agent, ‘the controller,’ which when considered in political terms evokes the feeling that this control is backed by coercion. However, the cybernetic imagining of control is more organic, connoting regulation or balancing

>>The cybernetic concept of control (or regulation) [...] maintains that regulation is a universal and ubiquitous phenomenon. **While there are no systems (and no societies) without regulation, regulation rarely takes the form of coercion or linear causality. This is because complex systems are ‘highly differentiated’, which prevents them from being easily steered from a control centre.**

**This is because complex systems are ‘highly differentiated’, which prevents them from being easily steered from a control centre.** [39] **The notion of ‘highly differentiated’ rings true for systems which are politically decentralized and is thus more in keeping with values of DAOs.** Furthermore, there are mathematical rigorous treatments of multi-agent control systems informed by observations of self-organizing systems in nature. 

The cybernetics lens is an engineering heavy perspective for exploring decentralized governance. It needs to be contrasted with social science perspectives such as law, economics, and sociology
