Alex Kruger: Something the public maybe missing: the company that has the assets & company that went bankrupt (intervened by bhamaas) are separate companies. They have headquarters in bahamas and then digital company is in antigua. During week, friends and family making up excuses to get funds to US entities. Bankruptcy ch. 11 should have been done on Friday, not days after. 

There was a hack on Saturday morning. 

Friday night (12th, my first day home after my wild long travel day), was wild, mainstream media talking about. 

Where is clarity on where 600M in funds went? Alex: very likely, internal hack. how convenient that it happened right after ch. 11

Alex Kruger: **99.99% of people who are active in crypto (live in crypto) not passive traders but people who manage money every day, had no idea this was coming.**
All started with a Coindesk leak of Alameda balance sheet. Such a shock. 
Alameda and FTX were supposed to be separate. SBF said they are separate and just another liquidity provider. 

Genevieve: most of his customers assets were offshore in bahamas so he violated terms of use. will he be prosecuted in US or in bahamas? 

**Scott: no one goes to jail for financial crimes!** 

Genevieve: Assets were supposed to be frozen later Ch. 11 bankruptcy. Bahamican govt. started to move money out of the exchange then realized they can't do that. To me, that spoke to the unsophistication of the govt. that we're dealing with over there and the lack of ramifications. 

Peter Tchir: **Distressed debt guys are very good**. 

Scott: It's impossible to process what is happening b/c its happening so fast. 
Could SEC have protected consumers? 

Genevieve: CEO of Coinbase says they're regulated business. **Must hold 1:1 assets of customer deposits**. **Because of lack of regulation from SEC, it's pushed capital offshore. 
There is a lot of pressure now from SEC to clarify.** **Hester Pierce said its SECs fault for not being more clear. She's been critical from the beginning.** 

Peter Tchir: **Comes back to bitcoin trust in US.** When it was trading at a premium, easy way for crypto traders to make money because more units were issued every 6 months so bigger AUM. But when it started trading at a discount, that changed. Discount to NAV tends to lead flows. **In ETF**, there is a two way arm (redeem or create), but in this vehicle it's stuck on people's balance sheets. ETF would help. 

Alex Kruger: **Having an ETF would have diminished the size of the impact. Would be less speculators. Many utility tokens would be securities and issued properly. But I don't think it would change the fact that SBF is a psychopath who lied many times and to Congress.** 

Genevieve: **Personality types that we put on a pedestal. Eg. elizabeth holmes. Who lack empathy or lack or responsiblity to customers/investors. They will always exist in society. These people are wired differently (nature vs. nurture of course).** 
**How did FTX dominate so much in just 3 years? Where did he get capital to set up shop?** Spreads on exchanges were pretty normal at that time.  

Melker: Binance was first investor and incubator. CZ taught SBF ropes but also had money from Alameda. **Edge for FTX was they were unregulated.** 

Kruger: **FTX was the best exchange tech wise. E.g, how does a gamer who have cheat codes win? They could print their own money (which they did) They printed money by creating FTT then Serum then they kept printing more shitcoins. Can see on balance sheet. They were using their own liquidity to manipulate price and then taking loans against their balance sheet (tokens were collateral). They were putting money into Defi and using it as collateral.** 

Genevieve: 2.1 Billion in Serum coin (now worthless)

Peter: Ripple effects into non crypto markets. 3 Trillion to .5B now. **Amount of wealth destroyed is huge. FTX is buying ad space, web services, servers, etc. And there are many crypto companies like that. Need to show growth at all costs. Employees felt rich. So much wealth creation to economy. Old economists were dismissive and didn't see the impact to economy. 3T is a lot to add to economy. Will put inflationary pressure on economy. Many trad'l economists ignored it on the way up. Perhaps more bloat in crypto because it's a more speculative assets. Goes straight to money printer and covid response. 
ARC traditional equity too.**

Melker: Can see this with public miners. Bought a bunch of miners that were delayed 6 months. Peter, you're missing an important element. Which is the responsibility of the Fed and money printing. Same thing happening in real estate and in used cars. Goes straight to money printer and covid response. Quantitative easing. **Newman's cradle** the ball at the far end explodes. Crypto and riskiest stocks exploded. **QE goes to asset price inflation**. Don't see it at the assets they're buying because risk gets pushed out to the edges. I think will create downward pressure. I have no idea how to value tokens. **For stocks, we have mechanism for understanding cash flow and valuation. But not for tokens.** 

Alex: **FTT was clearly a Ponzi insider.** **FTT can be valued in a systematic way. FTT represented an exchange seat - discount on trading fees. Same as with traditional exchange. Back in the day was like 200k to buy a seat, now nothing.** 
With QE this time, unlike 08-14, it went straight into the economy. In 08-14, deposits barely changed but in 2020 deposits did go up. 

Peter - **common theme is circularity. like Enron. you're using equity to collateralize things, rather than debt or things at the bottom of the cap structure. For a coder, eg, anything that is circular is hard to debug. When it unravels, it unravels quickly.** 



Was SBF's intent criminal? 
- **SBF mentioned missing an 8 billion dollar line lol They're using a google spreadsheet.** 
- Peter: Customer deposits are a liability! Not an asset. It's not your capital. 
- **FTX said in terms of service they are holding 1:1 of customer assets. FTX is a custodian! They're supposed to hold customer deposits!!**
- Kruger: **On FTT, Over 90% of supply was not circulating yet, so not issued, but they were taking loans against the full amount. Taking loans against unvested assets. Discount would need to be extremely cheap.  FTX could toggle circulating supply of FTT. So at a click of a button, could create more supply to take loans against.** 
**- SBF's problem was ego not wanting alameda to fail. similar to luna and terra. but he never knew it would blow up. just like voyager and btc etf.** 

Kruger: regulation should change so that exchanges should not be custodians. it's a no brainer. 

Genevieve: mututal funds, hedge funds cannot custody their own assets. A 3rd party needs to custody assets. In crypto, exchanges also should not be custodians, just like in trad fi. Crypto exchanges are operating as banks, custodians, trading platforms, and earn yields. In US, in trad. fi those entities would never be together!

Peter: Need a clear separation of church and state (haha but in US those aren't separated). 

Genevieve: Opportunity to make cold storage piece really easy. So gma could use it. Haven't happened it. 

Alex: **Answer is defi. Defi allows us to custody our own assets. Manage your own risk and hedge and trade. It's not just about speculation. Hedging is really important for wealth protection. Will take a lolng time, but clearly defi is the answer. We don't need trad. fi framework.** 

Scott: **I agree with both of you. In ideal world, Alex. But realistically, genevieve and grandma. CZ had quote about this:** 
	> CZ said at his press conference... **"until we can get Grandma to easily take her bitcoin off exchanges and secure her own keys without it being difficult the industry won't and can't move forward."**
	
Scott Melker: **BNY Mellon is already custodying crypto. For mainsream adoption. Most people would lose keys in self custody if forced into it. Single point of failure is yourself.** Mainstream adoption will be slowed down until there are more custodians. 
**(Reminds me of Big Short quote about how people choose authority because it seems authoritative or familiar, but not because of results. People like authority!)**

Peter: Institutional interest will wane until we have a trusted custodian. Until someone steps up. On institutional level, people will be reluctant to step in. We're now years away from adoption. People don't want to hear complex tech things now. 

Fidelity will soon be offering retail custody. (already institutional for a long time)

**Scott: This has nothing to do with the technology or the asset. Its people who are young and egotistical making bad decisions. Good to buy crypto now** 

**Genevieve: Fed has said they want unemployment rate to go up to tame inflation.**
