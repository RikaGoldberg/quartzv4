It's important to understand the different personas of MetaGame, and more broadly the different people who play blockchain games. 

Naavik has a good article on this called [The 9 Types of Blockchain Gamers](https://naavik.co/digest/blockchain-players) that breaks down the different gamer personas. 

Who are the players within MetaGame's ecosystem? The tentacles are vast, yes, but where are we keeping track of the different personas?

The article has the following breakdown:

**Investors**
1. Crypto Whales
2. Early Adopters
3. Entrepreneurs

**Earners**
1. Silent Investors
2. Market Speculators
3. Workers

**Players**
1. Toe Dippers
2. Gamblers
3. Fun Seekers

LP Providers for [$SEED](/notes/$SEED.md)on the Mainnet [Balancer](/notes/Balancer) Pool probably fall under Investors. We'll be reaching out to them to let them know we are deactivating swaps on the Mainnet pool, encouraging them to move their liquidity over to Polygon.
