Quotes:
"Why did I invent these peculiar people? Not just so that the could contain, halfway through it, the sentence **"The king was pregnant"** - though I admit that I am fond of that sentence. Not, certainly not, to propose Gethen as a model for humanity. I am not in favor of genetic alteration of the human organism - not at our present level of understanding. I wa not recommending the Gethenian sexual setup: I was using it. It was a heuristic device, a thought experiment. Physicists often do thought experiments. **Einstein shoots a light ray through a moving elevator; Schrodinger puts a cat in a box.** There is no elevator, no cat, no box. The experiment is performed, the question is asked, in the mind. Einstein's elevator, Schrodinger's cat, my Gethenians, are simply a way of thinking. **They are questions, not answers; process, not stasis. One of the essential functions of science fiction, I think, is precisely this kind of question-asking: reversals of a habitual way of thinking, metaphors for what our language has no words for as yet, experiments in imagination."**
