Mike, my good friend and yoga teacher, founder of Outdoor Yoga Berkeley, shares brilliant tidbits during his classes. 

Like this one: you can't fold your clothes while they're in the dryer. You need to first take the clothes out of the dryer, then you can fold them. 

What does this saying mean? 

To me, it means that we can't act from a resourceful place, we can't make good decisions, our prefrontal cortex is not activated, when we are in our emotions. We have to step out of our emotions and just be aware of them, before we can make good decisions. We are not our emotions. They're just objects that happen within us, but we don't have to have them overtake us. 

We are not anxiety. We are not depression. We are experiencing anxiety and depression. 

We are not stress. 

We need to get out of the emotion, out of anxiety, out of anger, out of fear, out of excitement, and into our core self, to get into a resourceful state so we can make good decisions. 

This is the subtle art of working with our emotions.
