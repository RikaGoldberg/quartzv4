## Highlights
What if grants are a black hole? Or, if grants end, will the ecosystem survive?

I believe this should be a genuine concern for every Web3 project. If it isn’t, then it might be worth becoming a concern, lest the project fades into oblivion. Massive funding masks the problem, but doesn’t make it go away.

As inspiration, we can look to organizations that have survived for decades and even centuries. That is, successful companies and nations. In this essay, I describe a core growth/sustainability loop and the role of stock and of fiat, for both both companies and nations.

**Every business needs a means to sustain itself. If they don’t, they die. Evolution filters, mercilessly.**

When the web started to get commercial in the mid 1990s, everyone searched for business models. The web was originally about content: one giant hyperlinked document. Many people tried business model of copying and pasting offline content into the online world. Or purely online content. This mostly failed.

Amazon’s famous loop, pictured below, worked particularly well. Better customer experience begets more traffic, begets more sellers, begets better selection, begets customer experience. This is growth. And this growth gives even more benefit: growth allows to lower the cost structure, which lowers prices, which further improves the customer experience. With the help of this loop, and with time to see the results, Amazon has become one of the world’s most valuable companies.

Some Web1 companies tried a web-native business model: treat the webpage as an application to buy things or interact with others, and take a cut. Some of these worked quite well, such as Ebay and Craigslist.

Revenue alone did not solve for cash at critical junctures: Amazon needed funds to get going in the first place. It needed those funds to hire employees who then built the initial product, in order to start getting revenue in the first place. Furthermore, as it was growing, it was at risk of getting out-run by faster-moving competitors, so Amazon needed more funds to grow aggressively, and revenue alone was not enough.

What did it do? It issued more company stock, and sold that stock to investors for cash. It issued stock to address the two junctures above. First, to kickstart the business, Jeff Bezos sold some stock to friends and family. Second, when Amazon’s business was starting to get traction, Jeff Bezos raised money from VCs to grow faster.

Issuing stock is a superpower for businesses. It pulls capital from the future into the present, based on the premise that allocating it effectively will increase the value even more in the future. Individuals can’t do this, families can’t do this, and cities can’t do this. But businesses can, and do.

The picture assumes that the only source of funds is tax revenue. That’s how governments typically approach budgeting. To illustrate: when a bill for X is proposed, the question “where do you plan to get the tax revenue to pay for X?” will inevitably arise. However, this is an incomplete picture: we must account for printing fiat. The next section elaborates.

The issuance of currency, “fiat” brings privileges and risks. In times of economic need, governments have the ability to “print more money” with the hope that the injection of cash into the economy helps to boost consumption with the goal to let the system heal itself and smooth out dips with economic downturns.

After an economy has recovered, responsible governments slowly remove the excess printed money to restore equilibrium.

The act of “printing money” is rife with risks. If too much money is printed, supply can outstrip demand, leading to price inflation because the excess money needs to flow somewhere.

Without measures to restore equilibrium, inflation can spiral out of control and lead to hyperinflation where money becomes essentially worthless. When printed money is poorly allocated, it can get hoarded, which in turn can lead to economic inequality, societal unrest and economic dislocation for the most vulnerable low- to mid-income workers.

Used sparingly and with good judgment, printing fiat is a tool in a nation’s toolbox to spur economic growth and improve citizen well-being.

That’s the goal. How do Web3 projects actually do it? Here, we take a Token Engineering systems approach to modeling it. The image below illustrates for many Web3 projects. Founders generate tokens (left), get some initial cash by selling some tokens (middle-left), build the product (middle), then ship (middle-right) it to power a nascent ecosystem (right). Then the aim is to grow the $TOKEN value. To help this, the dynamics should be designed for $TOKEN to increase as usage goes up. The founding team sustains itself by selling down more tokens for fiat over time, as they do work to improve the product.

The main problem with this is that the founding team needs to continually dip into its supply of tokens to fund itself. That supply continues to dwindle, especially if the project has to pivot towards hitting product-market fit. With each dilution event, the founders’ incentive to make the project succeed is further diminished. If the supply gets badly reduced, the team will need to sell company stock or a second token, which then risks misalignment of incentives.

But there’s still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I’ll elaborate. If rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won’t get adopted because it’s seen as too extractive. If rates are too low (and usage isn’t sufficient) then revenue is too low.

Revenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses — but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises.

It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.

I call this the Web3 Sustainability Loop. The image below illustrates this. It has parallels to successful nations and successful businesses. At its heart is a loop, designed for “snowball effect” growth of the ecosystem. The Workers (center) do *work* to help grow the Web3 Project Ecosystem (right). Apps and services generate revenue, using the Web3 project’s tools. A non-extractive fraction of that revenue is looped back (arrow looping from right to left) as Network revenue to the Web3 community: to Buy & Burn $TOKEN (bottom left) and back to workers curated by the community according (center-left). To catalyze growth and ensure decent funding in early days, Network rewards (left) also feed to Workers.

Here’s the loop, in words: Projects are proposed, and curated, by the community. Projects are funded by Network revenue, and Network reward. As projects do *work* and add value, network revenue goes up and $TOKEN goes up, and ever-more funding goes to the community.

The last step causes positive feedback loop (snowball effect) such that over time, more and more projects get funded. It implies more constraints: Each project must add sufficient value to the ecosystem (on average). Value added to the ecosystem needs to get reflected in the token price

Let’s unpack “sufficient value.” When a given project gets funded, the people behind it will need to gradually sell tokens to feed themselves and complete the project. This causes downwards pressure on the token price. Therefore: on average, value added to the ecosystem from a project must exceed the value spent by the ecosystem.

Therefore, project proposals will need to include a model on ROI. Average ROI must be >1.0 for the ecosystem to grow.

What is the project’s expected return on investment (ROI)?

Expected ROI can be lower for lower-risk projects, and needs to be higher for higher-risk projects. It has similarity to the traditional VC thought process.

From an ecosystem perspective, if a project gets funding from outside the ecosystem, then it counts towards the value-add number, not to the value-spent number. This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.

Value can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It’s a chain going from core product → dapps → discovery & usage → actual value add.

There’s a second selection criterion for each proposed project looking for funding: it must help to promote the Web3 project’s mission & values (or at least not work against them). Without this, the proposed project might as well be a Web2 project. The point of Web3 is to help equalize opportunities for all people.

A recurring value is long-term thinking. Here are some approaches to help, using time-weighted voting power. In Conviction Voting, vote increases with the amount of stake and the time staked for the vote. In Arweave Profit Sharing Communities, votes are weighted by the number of tokens the voter holds, multiplied by the time they are willing to lock them. In Yearn.finance, weight is scaled by x/365, where x is days locked.

Ocean Protocol is a Web3 project that aims to spread the benefits of AI by equalizing the opportunity to access and monetize data. For Ocean, we have created a system-level design that follows the pattern of the Web3 Sustainability Loop.

The image below illustrates. It’s designed to achieve sustainability over decades via funding that goes to teams (Workers) that continually add value to the Data Ecosystem.

This post described the Web3 Sustainability Loop. It takes inspiration from both businesses/nations, which take as income both revenue and stock/fiat issuance.

Just as I was putting finishing touches on this piece, Ali Yahya posted a tweetstorm describing a Network Flywheel and a related video from May 2020. It was heartening to see the similarities: First, both start with perennial question of “what drives token value?” Second, and especially heartening, was the idea in both to use a positive feedback loop (in the control systems sense) to model dynamics of token value. Great!

The Web3 Sustainability Loop focuses on (a) token dynamics such that token value goes up as volume goes up (top right); and (b) using Network Revenue to do *work* to grow volume further. As a bonus, some tokens get burned as function of volume, which drives token value further yet (bottom left). This model directly links usage to value, and is amenable to valuation approaches like Net Present Value.

In the Network Flywheel, “Token Value” has two inputs: (a) Investors who “provide financial capital” to founders to “build the protocol and bootstrap some initial token value” [ref][and ref], and (b) Vision + Protocol: “the stronger the vision for the token value is, the more the value in the broader market” [ref] as the loop goes. This model relies more on investor sentiment, without strong connection between usage and token value.
