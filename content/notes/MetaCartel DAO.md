## MetaCartel Logo

## MetaCartel Motto
As the African proverb and MetaCartel’s motto goes:

>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

## ChiliMan and DAOs

ChiliMan is anthropomorphic. He’s not human, but he has human traits. He has a mustache, he makes music with maracas, and he brings good vibes wherever he goes. 

ChiliMan also loves people. He believes that if you bring a bunch of great people together who want to change the world for the better, and give them tools and resources, you can solve big problems. 

## Peter Pan and Origin Story
[Peter Pan](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_), the founder of MetaCartel DAO, says that the biggest lesson he has learned from crypto is this:

>Take a leap of faith. Be willing to wander and be lost. Follow an important cause and mission. Back yourself and something interesting will happen.

MetaCartel started from a Telegram channel. Peter wanted to solve a technical design challenge. 

![Metacartel working group](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OS53uT5h7-npQPB01Efngtxa41B2aXxgpNJtlxQkm7va7aDBt3g2do_61TEyx9PfztQJxmiSUGRyY08TXTL0MFySR9bxMF7e-nMrm9p11MbY0ciqbJ3GE_jW6A0iRJ-B_3dC6C6o)

Peter’s intention with the Telegram group was to build his reputation from a nobody in crypto to a somebody who can solve Ethereum UI/UX problems, and land a job. 

Peter wanted the working group to be serious, because he thought seriousness would help him land a job. 

But, little did he know, the working group that he formed had members with a completely different mindset. These were crypto OGs and they knew how to have fun.

So when as a joke, Peter (an undercover jokester), created the ChiliMan logo and shared it with the community, the working group, people loved it and voted to make it the official logo of the working group. 

Peter, luckily, was outnumbered. He now says, in retrospect, that the logo helped attract a lot of cool people to MetaCartel. 

Peter achieved one of his goals: to attract cool people to the working group and work on some interesting design problems

James Young, one of the members who joined Peter’s working group, was yapping Peter’s ear off about Moloch DAO. 

Moloch, soon to become the first-ever DAO, was launching and they were in the process of giving their first grant. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, and Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, gave $4M dollars to help launch Moloch DAO. 

Peter wanted to become a member of Moloch DAO. But, he was rejected. He didn’t have enough money to pledge membership. 

So Peter confronted the Moloch DAO founders, who suggested to Peter that he turn his working group into a DAO. They even encouraged him to fork (copy) [Remix your wei](/notes/Remix%20your%20wei.md) Moloch’s codebase.

With the encouragement of Moloch’s founders, Peter created the application layer for Moloch DAO. At the time, Moloch DAO was just a bunch of smart contracts without a front-end for users to interact with. Peter created that front-end, the application layer, making MetaCartel DAO user friendly. 

Now, Peter needed more people to join MetaCartel so he could execute on his vision of creating an altruistic grant giving DAO, kind of like an incubator for Ethereum projects. The DAO would pool money from members and give grants to people building on Ethereum. The DAO would not take a percentage of revenue or profits - it would be completely altruistic. 

Peter initially struggled with getting people to join MetaCartel. He also still didn’t have a job or money, but he continued to conscientiously spread the word about MetaCartel. 

During this troubled time, Peter referred to himself as MetaCartel’s lead slave.

But then the tides started to turn.

Peter was accepted to the Binance Tech fellowship where he was paid $5k/month, enough to sustain him and pay for conferences so that he could spread the message of MetaCartel. 

Finally, Peter’s hustling was starting to pay off.

More people started joining the DAO and some early supporters even took a leap of faith and contributed as much as 100 ETH. 

Why did people contribute so much? 

Peter says it’s because these early supporters knew that the cool thing about Web3 & Ethereum is that we have found ways to generate wealth sustainably, and the more wealth we share, the more wealth we can generate. 

And this is done by nurturing a community of good natured rebels and misfits who feel a responsibility to help and support others while also having fun.

## MetaCartel Mission, Values, and Manifesto
The most effective form of motivation is intrinsic, meaning you work because you want to; because you believe in the mission, because you align with the values, and because you see the impact your work is making.

Clearly communicating mission and values is super important for DAOs. It should be front and center and always top of mind for members. And if you’re thinking about joining a DAO, you should pay close attention to its mission and values. 

MetaCartel’s mission is to [accelerate the creation of Web3 with the belief that it will make the world a richer, fairer place](https://www.metacartel.org/about).

MetaCartel’s values are: 

* We are people first and take chances on people.
    
* We are action oriented and move fast. 
    
* We thrive in chaos and are comfortable with pressure. 
    
* We back ourselves and believe in the work we are doing.
    
* We do not believe in cynicism, we watch for opportunities
    
* We have a dancing chili as a logo, we have fun. YOLO.
