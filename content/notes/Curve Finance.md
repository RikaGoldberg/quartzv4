Curve is [one of] DeFi's leading [Automated Market Makers](/notes/Automated%20Market%20Maker.md)
[Key Components of Automated Market Makers](/notes/Key%20Components%20of%20Automated%20Market%20Makers.md). Hundreds of [Liquidity Pools](/notes/Liquidity%20Pool.md) have been launched through Curve's factory and incentivized by Curve's DAO. Users rely on Curve's proprietary formulas to provide high liquidity, low slippage, low fee transactions among ERC-20 tokens.

Those resources aim to help new and existing users to become familiar with the [Curve protocol](https://resources.curve.fi/lp/understanding-curve-pools), the [Curve DAO](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance) and the [$CRV token](/crv-token/understanding-crv).
