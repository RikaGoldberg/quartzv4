Traveled to Porto in March for the [ETHPorto Conference](https://ethporto.org/)

Started my trip in Lisbon. 

My goal for the conference is primarily as a diplomat for [MetaGame](/notes/MetaGame.md), the DAO that is funding my expenses but I also am here to meet new and different types of people in Web3 who I would not meet otherwise. I suspect the conference will attract a European based crew, so I will learn about the landscape here. What people are thinking about, what they are curious about, how they think about crypto and DAOs. The fundraisers are very different too. 

It will be a smaller event so more opportunities to have 1-1 conversations. Hopefully more deep and thought provoking. Less partying, less shilling, less marketing, less Web3 hype.
