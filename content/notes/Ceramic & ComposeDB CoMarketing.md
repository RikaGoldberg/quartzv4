#### Brain Dump

Michael Sena outlined his vision of the [dataverse](/Dataverse.md): a composable data ecosystem -- owned by everyone and no one. The Dataverse will play arguably the most important role within the Metaverse: a shared, high-performance, always-available graph of all data created and used by all applications.

Sena envisions a world where applications have backend infrastructures that are composable, meaning permissionless protocols that share data

Sena envisions a world where backend infrastructure is not proprietary, but rather freely available to be used by developers and users themselves as self-sovereign identity. 

MetaGame envisions people owning their profile data and developers being able to use profile data for use cases like games, etc.

MetaGame built the only profiles on Ceramic to data, working towards a future of decentralized identity. Where developers can reuse our profiles data to bootstrap their app, unlocking limitless composability within ComposeDB's open data ecosystem

Over the next five years we will see a massive explosion in the developer market and a full integration of permissionless protocols into the mainstream development stack, giving rise to a billion networked applications that run and interoperate on shared, composable backend infrastructures. That’s an app for every 10 people on the planet.

#### Outline

**Title** When profiles rule the world

I. MetaGame has started to build out the decentralized identity use case of ComposeDB on Ceramic
	A. ComposeDB on Ceramic powers many applications and use cases. Decentralized identity, which includes profiles, credentials, and reputation systems, is MetaGame's focus
	B. We're doing this because we believe in the future of the dataverse envisioned by Michael Sena and the Ceramic team as described n this post https://blog.ceramic.network/into-the-dataverse/
	C. We believe in a composable, web-scale data ecosystem—owned by everyone and no one. Where data is composable and reusable. 
	C. We also believe that over the next 5 years we will see a massive explosion in the developer market and a full integration of permissionless protocols into the mainstream development stack, giving rise to a billion networked applications that run and interoperate on shared, composable backend infrastructures. 
II. MetaGame's goal is to come up with standardized, composable models for profile-related data for any apps building on top of Ceramic to be able to use
    A. Imagine a Web3 gaming application that needs to bootstrap users
    B. Imagine an events platform that wants to create a member directory
    C. Imagine a user who wants to port their data from one of these above mentioned apps, with their reputation and credentials following them in a customizable UI/dashboard
III. What we have already built
IV. What we plan to build
V. A call to action for Web3 projects who want to get a demo of MyMeta Profiles and see how it can be useful for their project today
	
A. One such use case is decentralized identity - profiles, credentials, and reputation systems
B. MetaGame has st



Key points from [MetaGame Ceramic Builder's Grant Proposal](/notes/MetaGame%20Ceramic%20Builder's%20Grant%20Proposal.md):

**We aim to come up with standardized, composable models for profile-related data for any apps building on top of Ceramic to be able to use**

**create universal schemas & plug in other major identity solutions such as Lens or ENS, making it into a decentralized identity aggregator**

 **port their existing profiles over to the new system.** 

**Build out more functionality for **pulling in DAO memberships of existing MyMeta users, through data sources like DAOHaus**

**Resurrect the web3 profiles Telegram working group and coordinate with other reputation and identity protocols about integration with MyMeta**
