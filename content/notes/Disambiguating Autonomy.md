## Highlights
So the book is called anarchists CYBERNETICS by Thomas swan. It's from 2020. And the fifth chapter is control part two. And it is about effective freedom and collective autonomy.

So, for starters, I run into this problem all the time so I'm going to give my, my decomposition of the word I have is not an absolute one insofar as other people might use these terms a little differently. But if we really want to get the gist of the topics people address with the word autonomy.

There's a sort of political notion and there's a functional notion.

![political vs. functional autonomy](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006103057.png)

The functional notion is more technical one it basically when you think about an autonomous car, it has sort of a tactical, functional autonomy, literally, it can act and respond to its environment, according to its goals and constraints and whatnot, but it's it's something that we can think of in a very like software. 

Systems like has the ability to act on its own in the sense of the information system. The political version is a bit more like what you read about in believing doubts, right? You're talking about individual. individual autonomy means like when people talk about sort of self sovereignty and their ability to make their own choices, but there's also a collective notion of this, which is where a group is capable of making decisions and a lot of the times, you know, what we really need in order to interact with the world is collective autonomy along some group lines. 

And in many cases, we have to concede some of our individual autonomy to to be a meaningful part of the group, and possibly quite a bit when you look at all of the groups that we choose to be part of what's left is hardly something that you would say is totally, you know, able to do whatever it wants, but on the other hand, it comes with the richness of the interactions through all of those memberships or participation. 

So if we kind of just take for a moment that throughout this, I'm going to be quite precise about which autonomy I'm talking about.

I'm not going to say quote, autonomy very much. I'm going to point out which of these four things I'm talking about. So the since the chapters on **collective autonomy**, I pulled the definition straight out. It's the collectively determined capacity and scope and individual or group has **decided act within the constraints set by collective organization.**

So in a sense, it's what we can do together. Functional autonomy is the degree of flexibility an individual or group within an organization has to respond to complexity as they see fit. My preferred way of describing this is, for example, when Kirsten was driving boats for the Coast Guard and she's just a bit higher rank now. But when she was younger, she drove boats and she had functional autonomy. Actually, as the driver she got to make decisions immediately had basically command of the vessel even when there were other people on it have higher rank because you need functional and in particular, **tactical, functional autonomy** in that moment, in order to respond to the complexity as they see fit. 

That example also helps elicit why I choose to be very clear about the difference between **strategic and tactical, functional autonomy because she doesn't actually have the ability to deviate from the goals and there may still be some constraints on that.** And so you know, separating the functional autonomy and the sort of immediate opportunity to interact with or to respond to the environment is different from having full autonomy in the sense that you get to decide what you do with those **degrees of freedom** and so, I have chosen to more goal setting aspect of that **strategic functional autonomy**, which is still something that even software systems need to have in some cases, you will have a higher or goal dictated by a **higher order system**, which provides a lower level system with instruction, but that's **lower level system** may still have **tactical autonomy** to solve that problem as its effects. And that nests sort of infinitely as it were. 

It's important though, to realize that we're talking about processes and systems they don't necessarily have to be implemented in a centralized way. They can be just the the actual system itself can have functional autonomy and be distributed or like physically distributed or even politically decentralized. **Tactical, functional autonomy makes political decentralization possible.** So if you give people the degrees of freedom to decide what how to do things, you can still share a collective goal and in fact, have a maybe we could argue it's a distributed system at that point, but you know, shared goal, individual tactical autonomy pursuant to that goal, but then, you know, are there circumstances in which the of the **shared goals get thinner and thinner, such that you could call that system decentralized because the shared sort of strategic functional autonomy says, well, we just want to feel safe, and then the you know, the extent to which we define narrower goals for ourselves strategic functional autonomy resides within maybe**

Unknown Speaker  5:57  
a look. You know, more individual political economy, but the truth is that for real systems, they're just, they probably have modes, meaning like some things, **some aspects need to be shared by everyone that some aspects need to be pressed down to the edges.** And I think that you could recover an argument of quote, potentially quite mathematically formal argument for subsidiarity by looking at **pushing as much autonomy down as possible in order to achieve shared goals**. It's just a question of that again, that nesting of okay, but like **who sets the goals and therefore, you know, do I how much again, relative but how much autonomy do I have over my own goals, not just over my own means of achieving those goals.** So, in even the **functional side becomes relative.**

![social, political, functional](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006105715.png)

So, being careful about autonomy as a relative concept in both the political and functional or the **social, political and functional** is basically socio social and technical reads on this word, and I think that if we, if we take care with the use of the word, it can be very powerful when we use it lively and just talking about autonomy.

I think we muddle things, and we don't necessarily help achieve healthier systems. Not going to try to resolve the question of decentralization because it's about as complex as the term autonomy.

And I'm going to take like, probably 15 minutes just to talk about continue to talk about autonomy. So the I guess I sort of started the front row myself here. **So autonomy is relative**. So as I said, our reading defined **functional autonomy is tactical autonomy** that made some references to goals and our purpose. 

**Tactical autonomy is defined with respect to purpose or goal.** So we need a notion of strategic autonomy that sounds for goal setting. **So as long as tactical autonomy is something that requires a goal, then there is a kind of autonomy that supersedes it, which would always be related to goal setting**. I don't think that's a huge lift, and we see it all the time when we're programming automations that we have to automate, to accomplish something **and the capacity of the automated thing to optimize for an outcome requires it to be given you know, a target outcome.** So kind of switching, you know, kind of continue to go back and forth between the technical and more social context. 

![effective freedom](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006105855.png)

So whether an individual or group, **political autonomy is most often autonomy from some other actors, individuals or groups**. So it's very difficult to describe the political autonomy without having like an edge to something, right. If you just say, I'm politically a part of this, you're like, well, in a way, it means there's nothing to compare to. So it kind of collapses. So you know, as a group, and of course, you would start to look inside of the group and **compare the individual relative to the collective.** **But if you roll all the way up to the collective, with no other collectives or entities of the same order, nothing to compare to doesn't mean very much so it's important to understand that sort of autonomy, the political sense as we understand it, is basically always relative to something.**

Unknown Speaker  9:45  
So, now we're gonna do a quick intuition check. Once you get in on that in an autonomous car, if you didn't get to decide where it was going to take you, I would not **my individual autonomy in this case leads me to want strategic functional autonomy.**

In other words, I won't get in the car because I don't get to decide where it's gonna go. If I get to decide where it go where it goes, then fine. Like that's effectively calling an Uber because the car driver system is autonomous, and it's going to take me where I want it to take me. **So I have the strategic functional autonomy even though the driver has the tactical functional autonomy**. And if it happened to be an autonomous car in the sense that it was self driving then that self driving car replaces the car driver system. And so you continue to choose to get in it or at least I would, only if I would retain **that goal setting kind of autonomy**, even though I'm happily conceded the the effort the cognitive overhead, beyond that, because the outcomes the thing I want.

I will note though, that if it's an **autonomous police car**, I may not get the job to sit in, you know, again, maybe it's an autonomous car plus person system, but it may very well be tha**t that entity is capable of sort of superseding my individual autonomy by some collective autonomy as manifested by a government hopefully a legitimate hopefully, that's not like a secret police and that's someone who's coming because I don't know**.

But I'll try not to do anything that puts me in that situation. Alright, so, this sort of brings us to **constraints on autonomy**. 

![constraints on autonomy](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006104709.png)

**So, autonomous parts must operate coordination with other autonomous parts.** 

This is also directly for **the autonomous parts must operate within the intentions of the whole organization.** 

And **autonomous parts must face the possibility of being excluded from the organization as a whole.** 

So the first two are, I think, relatively straightforward means that if you you kind of have like a pairwise coordination or sort of a local coordination as long as there are many parts, you're gonna have part two part constraints.

And then as long as those parts are thought of as a whole, then you're going to have part to whole constraints. 

So interestingly, I would argue that the number two goes in both directions that **the whole is constrained by the parts and the parts are constrained, but whole**.

**So you know, part two, part one, part two whole, both, I would argue are bilateral.** And then the third one autonomous part. So let's fac**e the possibility of being excluded from the organization as a whole.** I think that this is sort of important. It's a lot of nuance here. 

And I think you could do a whole presentation on this but I think the idea is that **if there's no notion of a boundary, then there's really no way of giving me entity cohesion because this thing can essentially, I hate to say it, grow cancerously. 

I don't want to take this to its deeper sort of societal politically questions, although there's a little bit more coverage of that in the book. But **I think we're talking about systems that are, are technical or functional in nature, not necessarily societal at the moment.** But my way of reconciling that is that the function of a society system can include care for

Unknown Speaker  13:21  
its like membership. So at that point, you know, **it's not that people are being excluded because they don't contribute to the like technical production of the entity, but but rather than that, people might be excluded for refusing to care for the people who need care.** 

Not exactly clear how that will work out because it's, again, big questions of, sort of how to structure a society but it's important to recognize that saying that someone can be excluded is not equivalent to saying that people will be excluded for non productivity, **it means that they could be excluded in general for their behavior for their TOS the choice to act outside of what we might think of as the value system.**

Or the social contract or the Constitution permissionless protocol or just more generally, in a **permissionless system**. The idea is that the notion of exclusion or inclusion is kind of turned on its head and you know, rather than someone giving you permission to join the system, you effectively permission yourself by following the state of rules. 

**And as long as you follow the state rules, you get to use the infrastructure.** And as long as you don't, you don't, but then again, it's sort of baked into it. 

**And this is not printing in some way as a sort of natively internet thing because you program the rules, and you then encode the system in such a way that following the rules, allows you to use it and not following the rules prevents you from using it.**

And that that's just sort of like a **fact of the system.** It's not something that necessarily someone comes and enforces. But again, it's specific to a kind of protocol that is, can be manifest in that way that like, you know, in a **peer to peer network, you just get dropped.** If you're not following protocol, then sort of naturally we're going to move into this notion of **consensus decision making.** in a technical sense, consensus protocols provide a means through which software **agents and a peer to peer network agree on the state of the world.** 

This is in the political sense of collective autonomy. And in a functional tactical photography. Basically, we're we're giving each of the agency a set of rules about how they come to collective agreement on a fact or set of facts. They don't have the ability to sort of decide a new goal, but they can they don't have the individual the ability to sort of, I would say like overly assert their individual lives and they each have to agree on the same state of the world. 

But then can they have a lot of degrees of freedom in terms of what they do pursuant to that. So that's a way of thinking about consensus protocols. **For social side, consensus or weaker consent decision making aims to create shared rules and our goals that everyone can support that we slipped with.** And then I would argue that this is, again, politically collective autonomy, but functionally, its strategic autonomy. **It's the difference between deciding what it is we hope to achieve and what constraints we might hold ourselves to in pursuing that is actually quite different from deciding how you go about doing things but without having the power to decide what you're going about doing or what what value is, for example, what is what is considered value**. 

So then, we kind of come to this term effective freedom. I'm gonna I'm sort of paraphrasing, but the **both functional autonomy and selective autonomy are defined in part as negotiation between individualism and collectivism, between the desire for operational freedom and the need to remain part of an overarching organization.** So in effect, you know, we have to define the that freedom relative to other things and in my opinion, the essence of this is that strategic, functional, the **strategic functional autonomy at the collective scale is where we look for the capacity to self govern have the capacity to self organize, to define the goals and constraints and the the binding of the group to the shared goals and constraints that were defined together.** 

**And so that's how I would characterize effective freedom with basically the idea that cool We want freedom, both as individuals and as groups, and that we can organize ourselves in such a way that we have about as much of that as possible, while still respecting each other and pursuing shared goals.** 

So as far as blockchain related things, so I'm going to tie this into blockchains and potentially the legitimacy of those systems. So I'll note that protocols such as those used for peer to peer networks are clearly stated rules such that failure to adhere is tantamount to self exclusion. So we do have this connection back to be excluded one would argue then that this provides

Unknown Speaker  18:18  
this provides tactical autonomy **because you have to be able to participate in the protocol in order to be included.** But you know, as long as you need that, as long as you meet that one restriction, then you often still have quite a bit of degrees of freedom. 

And that this notion of self exclusion does come up. So it's the **individual choosing to participate in the poll, and thus binding themselves to the rules of the hole with the understanding that if they choose CS to do that than they can expect to be excluded from the network.** 

I think that that's helpful because it gives us a lens for seeing peer to peer networks in the context of these sort of four autonomies. Then sort of going to the very last statement in the in the chapter is the reading. We say that the freedom we embrace beer rights must get in control. 

![legitimacy, beer](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006110014.png)

That means that **people must endorse the regulatory model at the heart of the viable system in which they protect now,** obviously, that feels a little jargony but I think the key here is that that even control we're talking about is that **strategic functional autonomy.** It's that light some there still has to be some sort of decision about the regulatory model. 

**The thing that describes the system defines the sy**stem. And people have to be like, they have to actually endorse it, or they have to believe that it's appropriate to be part of it. And so it's kind of interesting to see it written this way because it's quite hard to dry out, but I hope that sort of having that pack to the other terms, it makes sense that **he's again, evoking the strategic rather than the tactical functional autonomy when he talks about being in control and endorsing and endorsing.**

So kind of wrapping up so protocols or rules which constrain individual autonomy they offer those same individuals to degree attack. 

There's something to be said right from the having rules tell you what you what you what you can do, because they don't just remove actions. **They give you a field of action.**

**And so insofar as you know you can do these things and that they're considered appropriate within the system, the whole then you have actually the freedom to do them, and to do them in near real time, which I think is actually pretty interesting and it goes back to the previous example about the boat driver where the fact that the rules say that you have the the autonomy to act in response to that stimulus allows you to respond, not have to go a goal of for permission or not having a question, you know, that's in your admissible action space.** 

Unknown Speaker  21:10  
so these constraints can be seen as legitimate by those persons **insofar as this enables the expression of collective autonomy**. Pursuant to goals. So in other words, how we have this ability to fulfill, act Express do and we are bound to have some goals or whatever it is that the rule set, essentially was created in order to enable **but as long as we had some say, or strategic autonomy over that goal and constraint making, then I would argue that that is a legitimate system.** And so, you know, that's legitimate constraints on our autonomy. 

![legitimacy](/images/Pasted%20image%2020221006113258.png)

When we're talking about designing rules, in our case, we're **designing effectively unbreakable rules, and so far as as long as the infrastructure is present, and you use it, it denies you actions outside of the ruleset** just a bit like the way physics works, right. So you know, when I think about rules, I'm not necessarily thinking about things where there's a force that will come in and enforce though I'll admit, I do use the police car example for a reason to sort of remind us that there are there is that, but I don't think there is only that **maybe a better way to disambiguate it is that one way of enforcing rules is with our in the sense of the police coming away against your will.** But another way is the way that like physics works, which is some rules simply are the way things work and no amount of trying would violate conservation of energy. 

For example, I think much of the **program programmatic mechanism design that we do involve systems that simply work the way they were you put into that they, you would you would exclude yourself rather than break the system.** So like if you think of these as emergent self organizing systems and you know, if you were to try to violate conservation of energy by not eating, you would die. If you were to try to submit transactions that were invalid under the mechanisms, they would simply not happen.

If you tried to, you know, break the peer to peer protocol and the peer to peer network just get dropped. But so like, you know, the enforcement in the system is generally the, the opposite of the exercise of power from the top and more of sort of self exclusion by our refusal to accept or by attempts, repeated attempts to use the system against its intrinsic rule sets rather than sort of the rules being superimposed.

I know that's not a complete solution. **But I think it's worth noting that systems that have their rules baked into them in this sort of physics like way, behave differently than systems that work through, like sort of enforcement by coercion**. Most of the cybernetics that are true, basically Applied Social Science of control theory like dynamical systems, and all my favorite methods. 

**So it's very useful for me as a way to reason about engineering mechanisms, engineering institutions through the construction of rules**.

So that's it. That's my little like fin. Hopefully, the math nerds get that that's an autonomous system. That's like QED or like sort of proof completed.
