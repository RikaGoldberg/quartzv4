Token engineering leverages the existing fields of:
- optimization design 
- software engineering patterns, and 
- simulation, verification, and design space exploration (CAD tools)

It gets more specific than that. Token design is _especially_ like evolutionary algorithms (EAs), where there are many agents “searching” at once and there is no top-down control of what each agent does. Agents live and die by their block reward or fitness. The table below summarizes the relation.

With such similarities, _we can use best practices from optimization / EA to when doing token design_. This is great news, because many people are Jedis in designing EAs and optimization systems.

Every mature engineering field has its corpus of building blocks .We have books for design patterns in architecture, software, analog circuits and, yes, optimizers. But, no one’s written the book on token design patterns, yet.

This article described how we can leverage existing fields to help design tokenized ecosystems: token design as optimization design; token design patterns; and token design tools inspired by circuit design tools. The overall goal is a practice of **token engineering**. We’ll get there!
