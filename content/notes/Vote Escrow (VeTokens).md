See: [WTF are VeTokens](/notes/WTF%20are%20VeTokens.md)

Basic economics is to reduce the supply of tokens to increase the price. On top of that, you can increase demand by making the tokens have utility - giving holders perks, yields, & governance. Holders should have claims to the tokens cash flows. 

If supply goes up, inflation increases and your tokens are worth less so you need to unstake them. 

As Trent writes in [The Web3 Sustainability Loop](/notes/The%20Web3%20Sustainability%20Loop.md)

>>A recurring value is long-term thinking. Here are some approaches to help, using time-weighted voting power. In Conviction Voting, vote increases with the amount of stake and the time staked for the vote. In Arweave Profit Sharing Communities, votes are weighted by the number of tokens the voter holds, multiplied by the time they are willing to lock them. In Yearn.finance, weight is scaled by x/365, where x is days locked.
