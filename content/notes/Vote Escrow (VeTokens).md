VeTokens are called “liquid lockers” because holders lock up their tokens in exchange for special rights. This prevents speculative selling like what happened with UNI and COMP, pioneers in Defi token design, because there was no underlying demand other than speculative selling.

A common pattern we saw in DeFi token design for projects that launched before mid-to-late 2021 was the “valueless governance token” model.
  
With this model, token holders are solely entitled to governance rights. While this may have been a way to avert regulatory scrutiny, and governance is certainly an incredibly valuable right, this meant that holders have no claim on cash flows, and the token provides no utility or perks to any stakeholders within the protocol; meaning that aside from speculation, there is no underlying demand for the token.
