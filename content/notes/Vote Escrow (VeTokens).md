Basic economics is to reduce the supply of tokens to increase the price. On top of that, you can increase demand by making the tokens have utility - giving holders perks, yields, & governance. Holders should have claims to the tokens cash flows. 

If supply goes up, inflation increases and your tokens are worth less so you need to unstake them.
