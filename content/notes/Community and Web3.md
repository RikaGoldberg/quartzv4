Womp…womp…womp..what led to the demise of these communities? 

  There are a few possibilities. Perhaps the community failed to attract genuine people who were looking for more substance than token speculation. Perhaps the community failed to create a shared identity and culture. Or perhaps members were not incentivized to help and support one another during tough times – the community failed to achieve stickiness.

Defi Edge: people panic sell. Tokens drop because people get bored or move on next shiny object or a whale or founder leaves. A community needs to have utility for it to survive in the long term.
