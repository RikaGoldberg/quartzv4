Anne-Laure did an interview about mind gardening where she said it's important to have a place to park your thoughts that are living in your head rent-free. 

A thought I have, that many others seem to have too, is this need for external validation. Like, everyone wants to have their pieces read. But how do we do it in a way that is in sync with the Universe/Internet, and not forceful? Like, hey, look at me here's my stuff. 

First step: Observation. What's the landscape like? Really paying attention. 

Instead of feeling like the universe owes you something, become one with the universe. Our subjective experience is also the objective experience. 

Stupid intrusive thoughts: 
I'm doing the wrong things by reading papers and sharing. By acting as a curator. A shepherd of knowledge. Fuck that thought.
