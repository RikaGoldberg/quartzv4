Summary:
Gibson, in the book neuromancer, coined the term cyberspace and the matrix. In this cyberpunk thriller, Case gets in trouble for stealing from his previous employer, who messes up his nervous system so he can't use his brain computer interface to enter the matrix.  He meets Molly Million who wants to help him, saving him, connecting them with Armitage who can use his latest tech to repair Case's nervous system in exchange for his services as a hacker. Then, Case learns the poison is in his blood vessels too and unless he completes Armitage's mission, the sacs will burst and his nervous system will be disabled again. 

The book coined popular terms like: [[content/content/matrix]], [[content/content/cyberspace]], [[content/content/Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE)]]
