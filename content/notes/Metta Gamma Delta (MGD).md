This quote from [The Patriarchs, Angela Saini; Quotes](/books/The%20Patriarchs,%20Angela%20Saini/The%20Patriarchs,%20Angela%20Saini;%20Quotes.md) caught my attention this morning as a good one to include potentially in the story's opening. Because no two DAOs are exactly the same, no fossils of how DAOs are organized, they each have a level of personality and creativity from founders and members, attracting specific types of people. MGD has its own flare. Genuino in Porto had its own flare too. Restaurants, homes, spaces. It's all a reflection of their owner. 

“The trouble with the entire line of reasoning employed by Johann Jakob Bachofen in 1861, then Lewis Morgan and Friedrich Engels soon after him, is that, as the anthropologist Adam Kuper notes in his book The Invention of Primitive Society, human societies don’t all necessarily trace back to one single point, to a time when everyone lived the same way. We may be able to draw some common threads, writes Kuper, but there are no “fossils of social organization.”
