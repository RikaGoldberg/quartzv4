## A Definition
DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. 

DAOs allow people to organize around a shared mission, make decisions, contribute skills, and get rewarded. 

DAOs are programmed using smart contracts on Ethereum.

In very simple terms, a DAO is a club with a shared bank account.

Some things DAOs do:

1.  Maintain a public transparent treasury with tokens and stable coins
2. Issue shares for new members
3. Members submit proposals for how to spend treasury monies (e.g., compensate members, fundraise, give grants, vote in new members)
4. Members can experiment with crypto primitives like emergent, non-hierarchical organizational structures and tokenomics to ensure the long term sustainability of the DAO


## DAO Philosophy
**Related to** [DAO Wei](/content/notes/DAO%20Wei.md)

A DAO is a [system](/notes/Systems%20thinking.md) with [emergence](/notes/emergence.md) as its core property. 

When learning about a DAO, it's helpful to play the role of Alice in Wonderland. You want to be curious and you want to be surprised.
