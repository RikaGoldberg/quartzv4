Fomo3D is a decentralized application (Dapp) running on the Ethereum exit-scam network. The game consists of a smart contract (an autonomous program on the Ethereum network) carefully programmed and deployed so that we as developers have no influence or impact upon the game, the Ethereum in the contract, or advantages thereof. The application itself is completely trustless, will run until the Ethereum network dies and no matter how tantalizingly large the pot gets, will only be paid out according to the game rules.
