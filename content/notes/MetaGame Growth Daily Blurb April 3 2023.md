[Ethereum Foundation](/notes/Ethereum%20Foundation.md) supported and sponsored [ETHPorto Conference](/notes/ETHPorto%20Conference.md) so it seems apt to start with them for growth/fundraising. 

Paul Wackerow from MetaCartel introduced me to Nuno Loureiro and Sara Amaral who were on the conference planning committee. With their support, I was able to present a talk on [EthPorto Talk - Gamification in Web3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FxkE5m-A_pukfe7tSysS2bEkG-NpiCY5QCXOlteCEHY/edit) and get up to speed on all things Portugal to prepare for my trip. 

There are a few reasons why I think MetaGame is a good candidate for an EF grant:

- The mission of the EF is very much aligned to MetaGame's. From the website: 
	> We provide grants and other support for open source projects that strengthen Ethereum's foundations, with a particular focus on builder tools, infrastructure, research and public goods.
- The EF funded DAO Drops. MetaGame recently ranked #4 on [DAO Drops](https://daodrops.io/) 
	- Latest grantees can be seen [here](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support)
- At the end of 2022, Ethereum.org launched "Quizzes" which is like a bare bones version of Quest Chains. https://twitter.com/ethdotorg/status/1587833328240971777

If we decide to apply for a grant, it would be useful to schedule an [office hours](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/applicants/office-hours) session
