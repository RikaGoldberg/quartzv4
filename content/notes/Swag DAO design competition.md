#quotes 
SwagDAO is a revenue generating DAO that aims to spice up the experience of buying dank swag online. Utilizing FOMO3D-like game mechanics through bonding curve auctions and NFTs to verify authenticity and enable member benefits, we will make swag great again!

SwagDAO has always been a project codename while we began to gauge interest in the idea and explore potential platform features. Now that the MetaCartel has decided to back the project, we want the community to assist us with creating an official brand for the venture â€” **after all, this will be a brand run by and for the community, where individuals will be able to directly participate in its success.**

We are calling on the community to submit their best brand strategies including name, tagline, and some logo direction (can just be a meme). We will be awarding 200 Dai for the best idea(s).
