The worst mistake we can make is to ask for feedback without clarifying what we’re looking for. Unless we’re working with a trusted peer who also happens to be a mind-reader, this is a recipe for disaster.

There are two main kinds of feedback:

**Tactical: “I see your goal. You could try this other route to get there—it might be shorter, simpler, or more fruitful.”**

**Strategic: “I see your goal. You should pursue this other goal instead.”**

Decide which one you want, and make sure to ask for it specifically. **Most people are looking for tactical feedback—tips on how to better achieve their goals. But when they seek feedback, if they don’t specify what they want, they often get dumped with advice on how to change their strategy.** They’re left even more confused than when they started.

I’ve had this happen to me many times before. One time, I was talking to a fellow writer about my approach for publishing my book of fables. I told them that I wanted to spend at least some effort (six months or so) exploring publishing options, and if I didn’t get any bites, I would fall back to self-publishing. I asked them what they thought about my approach. Instead of sharing tactics, they told me a story about a friend of theirs who had spent four years querying publishers before they finally got a deal to publish their book. “So, just keep trying, and never give up!”

I nodded, thanked them for sharing, but came away disappointed. I wanted tactics on my strategy, and instead got advice to change my strategy. I was frustrated in the moment, but later realized the fault was my own. I should have been more clear about the kind of feedback I was looking for. This is what I asked:

“My approach for publishing my book is to spend X months on outreach, then fall back to self-publishing. What do you think?”

Do you see the problem? “What do you think?” is far too ambiguous and open-ended. I should have asked something like this:

“If I only have X months for publishing outreach, what are the most impactful things I could do in that time?”

Note that I can still adjust my strategy as I see fit. Just because I asked for tactics on this strategy, doesn’t mean I’m tied to it forever. I can change my mind. I’m in control.

Even with clear asks, we still don’t always get what we asked for. If I framed the question to focus on tactics, and they still wanted to advise on strategy, they might respond with something like, “Well, I know you asked about how to X, but I really think you should Y instead…” That exposes their belief that they think they know better about what’s right for me. There are some cases (for example, a trusted mentor) where you might want to be open to this kind of feedback. Most of the time, I suggest that you be wary of it. In some cases, when someone makes a certain decision, they are threatened by the idea of you making a different one. If you ask them what to do, they’ll do their best to guide you along their own path, rather than what’s best for you. (I wrote more about this in my essay on Status Police.)

A friend once shared something that struck me:

“I wonder if I’m really seeking feedback on my work, or just seeking validation of myself.”

You don’t need to be validated by others. You are valid just the way you are, with or without your work. You are you, and that’s enough. Always.

Once your internal validation is strong, you won’t need to rely as much on external validation. You can separate yourself from the work, and internalize that feedback on your work is about the work, not about you. When you look at feedback objectively, it’s much easier to find the wisdom within it.

Focus feedback onto your work. Keep it away from you.
