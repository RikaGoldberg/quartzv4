I. Introduction
	1. So how do you change paradigms? [[Thomas Kuhn]], who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science, has a lot to say about that. You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm. You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one. You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.
		2.At the heart of a DAO are principles, fundamental truths about the wei of the DAO, constantly evolving, and serving as a fail-safe ensuring work is performed efficiently, ethically, and with quality.
		3. All of the DAOs that you will read about in this short story series, follow the principles of the DAOWei
		4. 
			The metaphorical use of DAOWei was coined by Yalor Moon,  an early member of MetaCartel DAO, a summoner of many DAOs, and a bridge builder.
					1. DAOs should be designed in alignment with the way of nature
						1. For example, an ant colony results in [[emergence]]
				2. [[self-organization|self-organizing]] can be an art form. It is so elusive and hard to understand that people, for centuries, thought it must be the work of a divine creator. 
				3. [[Google]]has written extensively on the best way to organize teams. They echo the belief that self-organization is the most bountiful property of a team. 
				4. The DAO motto should be: nurture self-organization in the short-term, and prepare yourself for tasty fruit in the long-term. 
					1. “In any complex endeavor, you can rarely forecast ahead of time which of several shared foundations will be the optimal one: you need only something that is ‟good enough,ˮ and let emergence guide you from there. #quotes [[Google]]
						1. But, be wary, [[Google]] heeds: "Note that self-organization requires maturity and discipline.” #quotes 
II. Thinking in Systems: The DAOWei
		1.  DAOs should follow the principles 
III. Doing the DAOWei
	1. "Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it’s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around a long time to tell you what happened."
	2. As I was studying the beat of MetaFactory to write this story, new chord progressions kept emerging - surely, a result of the uniqueness and diversity of MetaFactory - a beautiful testament to the value it places on autonomy and self-organization. 
	3. I want to give you a holistic, 360, understanding of MetaFactory - including all of its wonderful quirks and weirdnesses - but to do so, we must first get through the boring activity of aligning on key terms. Bear with me, please. 
		1. .Let's align on some definitions before moving forward with what is a [[decentralized brand]] 
			1. A [[brand]] is a name, term, design, or symbol, that distinguishes one seller’s goods or services from those of other sellers. 
			2. [[decentralized]]means the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.
			3. Let's look at what branding is from a historical lens: 
				1.  “The practice of branding - in the original literal sense of marking by burning - is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians, who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BCE. Branding was used to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.”
				2. Interesting! Societies, for thousands of years, have used various objects, even livestock, to capture value. No surprise, then, that our modern society places extraordinary value in a company’s, or a person’s, brand. 
			4. Let's define two more terms
				1. A [[brand community]] is a brand community is a group of like-minded people who form an attachment to a brand or product.
				2. A [[brand economy]] is a marketplace where a brand’s assets can be bought and sold
			5. Finally, we have a **starter** definition of decentralized brand that I will expand on so you get a holistic, 360 degree view of MetaFactory. 
				1. A starter definition of a [[decentralized brand]] is an apparel marketplace that sells dope products that are deeply valued by its community of loyal followers. The community makes decisions about which products are sold and the direction of the marketplace, without managerial oversight or a central approval authority. 
	IV.  SwagDAO: The Origin of MetaFactory DAO
			1. I want you to introduce you to [[Drew Harding]] the co-founder of MetaFactory DAO, and the creator of SwagDAO. 
			2. [[swagDAO]] was the first attempt at transforming crypto culture with fashion. The ground for transformation was extremely fertile: the existing fashion was barebones consisting of company swag like t-shirts. 
			3. Super basic and boring, but it worked. Like Drew says, he liked t-shirts, just like everyone else, and just like everyone who has been in crypto for a while, most of his wardrobe consisted of t-shirts branded with crypto company logos. 
			4. Drew wanted more. Specifically, he wanted to cultivate crypto’s community beyond just the tech. 
				1.  So when, in the year 2020, he attended DevCon in Osaka and noticed that project booths were full of piles of mostly t-shirts to give away as swag, he saw an opportunity to do more. 
				2. After a few ideating conversations with MetaCartel folks, he decided to, in true MetaCartel fashion, whip up SwagDAO: a sales platform for t-shirts. 
			5. Here’s how [[swagDAO]] would work:
				1. two t-shirt designs would be auctioned at the same time, but only one design would win. Bidders who bid on the winning design, only pay Cost of Goods Sold, subsidizing the losing bidders who must pay full price, MSRP, for the shirts. The auction would be live for 30 days, with the swag price dropping over time in line with a [[continous token bonding curve]]
					1. (note: a continuous token bonding curve is a smart contract that creates its own market for tokens without relying on exchanges). 
			6. I know this might sound complicated (and it is), but if anyone could pull something like this off, it’s [[Drew Harding]]
				1. Drew brings a ton of experience, more than a decade, from legacy mobile and web development. He ran two successful digital agencies and also has product experience. Clearly, he knows how to build on the Internet. 
				2. [[swagDAO]], however, would not just be another e-commerce platform that required a simple front-end design. Drew was experimenting with all sorts of wacky cryptoeconomic models like [[battle auction]] and [[FOMO3D-like game mechanics]]
					1. He needed cryptoeconomic designers who could model these principles and he would also need seasoned Solidity engineers to write the smart contract code whilst ensuring the highest security so funds are kept secure. 
		V. “Physicists often do [[thought experiments]]. Einstein shoots a light ray through a moving elevator; Schrodinger puts a cat in a box. There is no elevator, no cat, no box. The experiment is performed, the question is asked, in the mind. Einstein's elevator, Schrodinger's cat, my Gethenians, are simply a way of thinking."
			- [[Ursula Le Guin]]  from her essay: [[Is gender necessary?]]about her book, [[Left Hand of Darkness]]
			1. MetaFactory, in it’s short existence, since 2020, has already conducted tons of [[thought experiments]] - and has been well on its way to achieving its mission of becoming a [[decentralized brand]]. 
		VI. The DAOWei: Appreciate beauty 
			1. 	If something is ugly, say so. If it is tacky, inappropriate, out of proportion, unsustainable, morally degrading, ecologically impoverishing, or humanly demeaning, don’t let it pass. Don’t be stopped by the “if you can’t define it and measure it, I don’t have to pay attention to it ploy.” **No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth or love. No one can define or measure any value.** **But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren’t designed to produce them, if we don’t speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist.** #quotes 
				-  [[donnella meadows]][[Thinking in Systems]]
			2. A brand's value is intangible - it cannot be measured, but its beauty is most certainly appreciated by those with keen taste. 
			3. And as the novelist Margaret Wolfe Hungerford once famously said: “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” 
			4. Drew’s dream, starting from MetaFactory’s origin as Swag DAO, was to make beautiful t-shirts that were also quality. And he knew that he couldn’t do it alone. He would need not only a community of loyal followers, a brand community, **but also a co-founder - a clever fashionista who understood business, branding, and was also deep in the crypto scene.**
			5. In an attempt to find a person who checked those boxes, Drew created a branding competition for Swag DAO. He corralled crypto Twitter to submit ideas for Swag DAO’s brand strategy, including a new name, a tagline, and some logo direction. He also wrote up this [[Swag DAO design competition]] post and created this meme. 
			6. As you can tell from Drew’s vibe, the winner would have to be witty and clever, with a fun imagination. This person would have to mesh well with Drew’s joviality and, of course, not take themselves too seriously. 
			7. A handful of submissions came in, but one’s beauty stood out from all the rest. 
			8. Hammad didn’t just propose a clever name: MetaFactory; and a tagline, but he also created a theme and a cryptic story around the name. 
			9. Today, MetaFactory DAO members call themselves Robots, the token is $Robot, and a sub DAO was even created called iRobot. 
			10. The anthropomorphic Robot is clearly running the show, and as the brand continues to evolve, Robot will continue to be front and center in the narrative. 
		
1. Drew poses the question: "How can we cultivate community beyond the tech?"
						1. Swag DAO design competition was the first attempt at cultivating community to have the community set the brand's direction
							2. Then, Hammad won the [[Swag DAO design competition]]
									1. Utilizing FOMO3D-like game mechanics through continous token bonding cure vauctions and NFTs to verify authenticity and enable member benefits, we will make swag great again!
			2. MetaFactory's mission is to create a decentralized brand owned and run by the brand community and includes a brand economy
				1. Metafactory is streetwear, gaming, NFT art, and cryptoeconomics
				2. Create an immersive virtual world aka Metaverse
				3. Transform crypto culture through fashion
				4. Lower the barrier to entry for artists and
			3.  Metafactory's mission continous token bonding curve to battle game mechanics to curation games to Create an immersive virtual world aka Metaverse 
	2. Embrace good enough structures and processes on teams
		1. MetaFactory started out as Swag DAO, an apparel sales platform. Also, **an experiment for-profit revenue** generating DAOs. 
			1. [[swagDAO, an apparel sales platform, proposal on MetaCartel forum]]
				1. Auctions for products take place with a battle mechanic mechanism (James Waugh designing it). 
				2. "Leverage meme energy and competitive, FOMO3D-like game mechanics to increase FOMO and entertainment value / hype."
	3. Analogy of SwagDAO to sowing seeds in a garden
		1. crypto companies don't know legal implications yet of their work because it's a new industry. Companies are testing what will work and what will not. Pushing boundaries. in the real world, you know the boundaries . In crypto, you need to keep trying. Tis new. 
	4. MetaFactory wants to build a curation auction and it'll be just good enough. 
		1. Simon De Larouviere created the idea of a TCR 3 years ago, but it never really took off. MF, now is picking it back up!
		2. MF is going to leverage Simon's TCR to create curation game. neven done before. It has to just be good enough, otherwise they'll have a hard time changing it in a few years. 
			1. Is this different from web apps? This must be a development principle, already known.
	5. [[Working groups are an experiment in self-organization]]
		1. Devising clever rules by scaffolding good enough processes with working groups, so they can continually be modified. **A continous token bonding curve is evolving by design.**
