[[content/content/Metafactory wants to attract hypebeast brands by exposing them to new audiences]]

#fleetingnotes 
This was the first effort to create a [brand economy]]. The tokens, however, exist as a separate product, not directly attached to the socks.

I think decentralized brand economy means a market with a product is sold, to buyers and sellers, not on an exchange, right, so without an order book.  I think Uniswap doesn't have an order book. 

A brand economy includes streetwear, gaming, NFT art and crypto-economics, MetaFactory has developed a crowdfunding platform for the creation of limited run, custom goods with an initial focus on fashion and apparel.

The possibilities of an immersive virtual world where one can live out their greatest fantasies or explore their biggest fears in a way thats impossible in the physical, ‘real’ world is just upon the horizon.

In-game items, digital art and virtual land are experiencing strong demand and with their tokenization — we are able to trustlessly transfer value, the key for a virtual world to go from a game or an experiment…to a reality. But this transformation isn’t just one of technology or economics — its a transformation of culture.

**Inspired by streetwear, gaming, NFT art and crypto-economics, MetaFactory has developed a crowdfunding platform for the creation of limited run, custom goods with an initial focus on fashion and apparel.**

We curate and manage the product marketplace, promote auctions and stimulate community support.

We handle all product production & fulfillment on behalf of our partners, so they only need to focus on their art.

We understand the power of fashion to drive culture and community and will facilitate access to high quality production and fulfillment lowering the barrier to entry to an normally elusive industry.

By managing the marketplace and handling production & fulfillment, we can stimulate community growth while allowing creators to focus on their designs.

Seeing as fashion drives culture, MetaFactory recognizes that facilitating access to high quality production at the best possible price allows for an explosion of independent, communally owned and operated brands. 

**Unisocks sold a digital token that could be redeemed for a pair of socks. More specifically, it introduced a model where tokens are sold along a bonding curve with each purchase increasing the token price and the redeemable value of each pair of socks.**

**This was the first effort to create a decentralized brand economy.** **The tokens, however, exist as a separate product, not directly attached to the socks.**

In other words, any individual is able to buy and sell the tokens separate from the socks, promoting speculation by parties uninterested in the product or the brand itself. We recognize and appreciate the game theory of Unisocks, but believe there is a more value-added approach to build brands and elevate creators. The emphasis should be on the product itself and the creator behind it. Rewards should be shared by buyers, not speculators looking to make money ‘playing the market.’

Enter Non-Fungible Tokens (or NFTs). With an NFT, the product IS the token. When purchasing a product, buyers receive a token representing ownership and any associated benefits or earnings.

Each physical item will be embedded with a unique silicon chip that tracks the specific order number of that product and its associated metadata, linking it to its digital counterpart.

We have also partnered with a number of top artists and projects in the crypto space. Our launch partner designs are incredible and we are excited to have them join us on this journey. They are natural trend setters, cultural curators and creative leaders, sitting at the intersection of art and technology, writing and capturing society’s stories as they unfold.

Leveraging apparel as a new canvas for creators, MetaFactory will enable creators and projects to reach new audiences. The fashion world has seen the success of hypebeast brands and communities such as Supreme, Yeezy, Off White and others. MetaFactory aims to attract these same communities and expose them to the world of web3 including digital collectibles, virtual wearables, and decentralized finance.
