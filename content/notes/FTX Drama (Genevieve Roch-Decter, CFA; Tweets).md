Exchanges need to hold customer assets 1:1 in the asset type they were deposited. 

Exchanges need a third party to be the custodian of the customer assets. Must be a separate company with separate management and board than the exchange.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities. Every other token is automatically deemed a security and regulated as such unless proven otherwise via a thorough process.

Exchanges issuing their own token and using it as collateral is a red flag, especially when they simply print it out of thin air. This should trigger a regulatory review.

Maybe it wouldn't have mattered anyway because regulators usually act like coroners than investigators: They only spring into action after all the damage is done to count the bodies and clean up the crime scene.
