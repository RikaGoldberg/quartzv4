#### Working On ...

High Level: 
- A more pragmatic narrative than the current "we are redesigning society" one. I mean, that's a great mission but we need to infuse some practicality into it to keep contributors focused day-to-day and working towards concrete goals. 
- Understanding gamification principles 
- Growth/Fundraising, which includes helping MetaGame to decide on a legal entity *note to self: Kyler recommended 501c(6)*
- Participating in The Community (this is ad-hoc) (e.g., finding & coordinating speakers for community calls)

Low Level: 
- [ ] Add Coordinape contributions for March 
- [ ] Write outline for Ceramic/ComposeDB post
- [ ] Write a draft Quest Chain of [Decentralization - DAO Research Collective](/notes/Decentralization%20-%20DAO%20Research%20Collective.md)for build in public session on [[Journals/2023-04-04]]

#### What is MetaGame? 
- MetaOS
- Seed market
- Open roles 
- Quests
- Guild Explorer

I like Hbesso31's TL;DR from his [forum post on MetaGame and Urbanika](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/metagame-and-urbanika-a-powerful-use-case/1110?u=hbesso31)

-   **MyMeta**, a social media platform where users can create web3 personal profiles and connect with others who share the same interests,
-   **ChievMint**, an NFT minter that celebrates people’s successes,
-   **QuestChains**, a place where users can find and commit to completing challenges in exchange for a certificate that attests to their achievement, and
-   **Dashboard** a personalized panel from a DAO that shows the most recent news, social media posts, and videos, as well as a leaderboard that ranks users by the experience points (XP) they have earned for contributing to the DAO in regard.  
    -**MetaSys**, a gamified accounting contribution system that turns actions into XP and then to token allocation.

#### Growth
In my latest [Mochi](/content/notes/Mochi.md) journey, I set a goal to write a [daily blurb](quartz/content/notes/MetaGame%20Growth%20Daily%20Blurbs%201.md) about MetaGame growth/fundraising. 

#### How does MetaGame Do What and Why

I'm [Championing MetaMedia](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/rika-goldberg-to-champion-metamedia/1052) which is a fancy way of saying that I'm thinking through content strategy.  Importantly, the initiative needs to be sustainable. People need to be paid and incentivized to work on this. 

**This is outdated & needs to be updated**
What are we doing? We're scouting Playbooks creators(outside of the MetaFam!) and giving them grants, hopefully funded through [MetaCartel Grants](https://forum.metacartel.org/t/metamedia-chili-pod/2731/9). Our unique value add is that the playbooks will become micro courses on MetaGame and reach 15k people.  

1. We really want to fund creators outside of the MetaFam ecosystem. (win/win to share audiences)
2. We want to provide Playbooks as a Service to DAOs (immediate next step is to do a little user research to understand what DAO needs are for playbooks)
3. Sponsorship

#### Brain Dump

MetaGame is very developer heavy.  And people do a lot of different activities. That's the way it should be. People work on what they are interested in, there is autonomy and freedom, and things happen. I keep thinking about how it's important to watch out for number one. The collective, koombaya, trying to please everyone vibe doesn't work. In DAOs, just like in real life, there are the people who will manipulate you (control you), who will not do work, who will be fake nice, who are talking heads but won't actually take action. 

#### MetaGame Tech
MetaGame received a grant from 3Box Labs, getting [Ceramic 1](quartz/content/notes/Ceramic%201.md) Builder's grant. I summarize the proposal [here](/notes/MetaGame%20Ceramic%20Builder's%20Grant%20Proposal.md)
