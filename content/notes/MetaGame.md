#### Growth
In my latest [Mochi](/content/notes/Mochi.md) journey, I set a goal to write a [daily blurb](/notes/MetaGame%20Growth%20Daily%20Blurbs.md) about MetaGame growth/fundraising. 

#### How does MetaGame Do What and Why

I'm [Championing MetaMedia](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/rika-goldberg-to-champion-metamedia/1052) which is a fancy way of saying that I'm thinking through content strategy.  Importantly, the initiative needs to be sustainable. People need to be paid and incentivized to work on this. 

**This is outdated & needs to be updated**
What are we doing? We're scouting Playbooks creators(outside of the MetaFam!) and giving them grants, hopefully funded through [MetaCartel Grants](https://forum.metacartel.org/t/metamedia-chili-pod/2731/9). Our unique value add is that the playbooks will become micro courses on MetaGame and reach 15k people.  

1. We really want to fund creators outside of the MetaFam ecosystem. (win/win to share audiences)
2. We want to provide Playbooks as a Service to DAOs (immediate next step is to do a little user research to understand what DAO needs are for playbooks)
3. Sponsorship
