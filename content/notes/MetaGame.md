#### Growth
In my latest [Mochi](/content/notes/Mochi.md) journey, I set a goal to write a [daily blurb](/notes/MetaGame%20Growth%20Daily%20Blurbs.md) about MetaGame growth/fundraising. 

#### How does MetaGame Do What and Why

I'm [Championing MetaMedia](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/rika-goldberg-to-champion-metamedia/1052) which is a fancy way of saying that I'm thinking through content strategy.  Importantly, the initiative needs to be sustainable. People need to be paid and incentivized to work on this. 

**This is outdated & needs to be updated**
What are we doing? We're scouting Playbooks creators(outside of the MetaFam!) and giving them grants, hopefully funded through [MetaCartel Grants](https://forum.metacartel.org/t/metamedia-chili-pod/2731/9). Our unique value add is that the playbooks will become micro courses on MetaGame and reach 15k people.  

1. We really want to fund creators outside of the MetaFam ecosystem. (win/win to share audiences)
2. We want to provide Playbooks as a Service to DAOs (immediate next step is to do a little user research to understand what DAO needs are for playbooks)
3. Sponsorship

#### Brain Dump

MetaGame is very developer heavy.  And people do a lot of different activities. That's the way it should be. People work on what they are interested in, there is autonomy and freedom, and things happen. I keep thinking about how it's important to watch out for number one. The collective, koombaya, trying to please everyone vibe doesn't work. In DAOs, just like in real life, there are the people who will manipulate you (control you), who will not do work, who will be fake nice, who are talking heads but won't actually take action.
