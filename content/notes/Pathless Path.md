[[content/content/What Makes Work Meaningful — Or Meaningless|A study from the University of Sussex by professors Bailey and Madden]] should cast doubts on whether these expectations can be met. In their research, they did in-depth interviews with 135 individuals in 10 different professions about the most meaningful moments in their jobs.
         Their conclusion: “helping people find meaning in their work is complex and profound, going far beyond the relative superficialities of satisfaction or engagement.” **Their research found that instead of joy, meaningful experiences were “associated with mixed, uncomfortable, or even painful thoughts and feelings, not just a sense of unalloyed joy and happiness."**

Despite thinking I wanted fun and joy at work for most of my career, when I reflect on the most meaningful moments of my career, they involve overcoming obstacles, or getting through setbacks to complete something I didn’t think I could.

This is much different than what most companies are promising and increasingly, what many people have come to expect out of work.”

“Sociologist André Gorz spent the latter half of the 20th writing about the role of work in society. He argued that many countries had evolved into places where the primary way one gained “membership” in society was through formal work. He called these places “wage-based societies” where the central ethic was, “never mind what work you do, what counts is having a job.”

“Seeing the job as a central element of a good life and employment rates as a metric of a successful society was not a common assumption until after World War II. In 1946, the United States formalized this by passing the Full Employment Act “to promote maximum employment.”

One striking example is from 2009 when U.S. President Barack Obama explicitly mentioned jobs as the reason why he did not want to pursue a more ambitious healthcare policy:”

“Everybody who supports single‑payer healthcare says, ‘Look at all this money we would be saving from insurance and paperwork.’ That represents 1 million, 2 million, 3 million jobs of people who are working at Blue Cross Blue Shield or Kaiser or other places. What are we doing with them? Where are we employing them?''

***- Paul is wrong. This quote is from senator Obama in 2006.*** 

Regardless of whether single‑payer healthcare would have improved lives or not, this decision shows that, at least in the United States, government leaders prefer to create or save jobs rather than doing anything that risks losing them. For Obama, it was also a smart decision, as the healthcare sector was one of the few areas that saw continued job growth after the 2008 recession, and the good “jobs numbers” were a key reason Obama was able to win re‑election.

“Based on this analysis, you could conclude that jobs are good, full stop. Unfortunately, this way of thinking is challenged by the dramatic shifts in the ways people are working. In 2016, economists Lawrence Katz and Alan Kreuger highlighted a group of 30 million people categorized by the U.S. government as “alternative” or “nontraditional” workers and showed that they were responsible for nearly all of U.S. job growth from 2005 to 2015, adding nearly 10 million jobs.”

“McKinsey & Company found similar trends across Europe and estimated that more than 100 million people across the United States and Europe are now “nontraditional” employees. McKinsey compared these workers to “traditional” employees and found that they were as satisfied or more satisfied across fifteen different work characteristics, such as income, independence, hours, flexibility, creativity, and even recognition.44 Though this group is quite large, it doesn’t have a cohesive voice, and people are often surprised to find that most of these “alternative” workers are quite happy.”

“Yet at McKinsey, proving your commitment to work came in a different flavor. The work was much more interesting, but it seemed that people were in an endless search to do more. In my first week on the job, my manager told me that I was expected to work 40–50 hours a week and I took her at her word. Yet most of my colleagues worked 50 to 60 hours a week or more.”

“My colleagues always laughed when I left the office at 5:30. “Paul can get away with it, he’s just different,” they would say. I thought I was simply more efficient and worried a little less. The reality was that I never bought into the wage‑based mentality and could never fully commit to placing work at the center of my life.”

Choosing to leave full‑time work was not a single bold decision but a slow and steady awakening that the path I was on was not my path.”

“It’s tempting to tell a simpler story. People want to hear about bold acts of courage, not years of feeling lost”

“A friend, Khe Hy, provides a perfect description of this phase. Fifteen years into a successful career in finance, he walked away to find a new path. However, it took him a long time to make that decision. He reflected, “It definitely wasn’t a sudden realization. It’s a little bit like having a pebble in your shoe, where you’re walking and something is off, and it’s mildly uncomfortable”

“When he got raises or promotions the discomfort would subside but never disappear. Slowly, he became more curious about that feeling and realized that despite his external success, he had become a “passive participant” in his life. Eventually, this convinced him to embark on his own pathless path.”

“As I started to pay attention, I slowly came to realize the reality that I had been living in was an invisible bubble, one of my own creation. I started to push the edges of that reality and wasn’t sure what would happen.”

“Instead of being consumed with thoughts about work and my next step, I had time to continue to experiment, and in the space that emerged, a creative energy entered which started to become a central force in my life.”

“Instead of being consumed with thoughts about work and my next step, I had time to continue to experiment, and in the space that emerged, a creative energy entered which started to become a central force in my life.”

“As I started to test my boundaries, I split into two different versions of myself. One, “Default Path Paul,” focused on continuing my career, looking for the next job. The other, “Pathless Path Paul,’’ was finding his footing and starting to “pay attention to the clues that were showing up. Clues that would lead me not to another job, but to another life.”
