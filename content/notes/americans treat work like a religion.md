There are three major religions in the world: Christianity, Judaism, Islam. Americans have added a fourth: work. 

As I write in [Newsletter 51 The power of quiet confidence](/newsletter/Newsletter%2051%20The%20power%20of%20quiet%20confidence.md) I respect all religions for their shared stories, teaching us about the goodness in ourselves and others - morals, values, ethics. 

Can the work religion have some good stories to share too?
