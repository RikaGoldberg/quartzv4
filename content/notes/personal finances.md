Overarching [[content/content/principle]] : [[content/content/Embrace good enough structures and processes]]


As an entrepreneur, my personal finance mindset has inevitably changed. I have multiple income streams and I am open to different writing opportunities. New opportunities can come in a flash and I need to be ready. 

Additionally, I am working with crypto and I would like to get more familiar with crypto apps so I can make passive income, invest, and set myself and harry up for a good financial future. 

There is also this rich life thing harry wants us to do. 

And, of course, every year there are taxes, which is a good time to rebalance traditional financial assets. 

I want to use defi applications.

I want to look into opening a solo 401k
