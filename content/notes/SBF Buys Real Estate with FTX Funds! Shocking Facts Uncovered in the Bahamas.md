Real estate purchased was not in the name of FTX Digital Markets (the regulated entity). Instead, in the name of FTX Properties Ltd (just for properties). In Oct. before everything crashed, Alameda Properties was opened. 

Property values in the Bahamas have always been going up. People make profits in crypto and use it to buy property in the Bahamas. Spend 500k and you can apply for residency in the bahamas. 

Bahamians can't freely invest outside of the country. Crypto people are trying to make Bahamas a crypto hub, but Bahamians can't use crypto. They'd go to jail. It's an apartheid type law. 

On fTX, you could bet on Trump winning election in 2020. 

Your money was taken, off of exchange, to buy properties, so you would never see your money again!!

Ryan Salame, 8.7M dollar properties. $16.5M for his parents. 

Barbados told him no but Bahamas took him in because they have corrupt politicians. New laws were created for SBF!

SBF didn't have any minimum capital requirements b/c FTX didn't have any capital!! 

Bahamas has too many corrupt politicians so it needs to be adjudicated in the US. 

Prime Minister chose to speak in the House of Assembly, where you have immunity about whatever you say in the H.of.A rather than at a press conference. 

PM sent Attorney General to speak at Press Conference.

PM started to make excuses like many crypto companies have failed. Started talking about Bankman Fried. So he's defending him. 

Bahamian govt. doesn't want their people to speak about it. If Bahamians don't speak out, they are complicit ith the corrupt government. 

People connected with political parties have shares in the government. The govt. didn't speak for over a week. Happened on Nov.  11 but took them 1 week to speak out. 

Police is saying they're waiting for Securities Commission, but they're the ones who caused this with lax laws and policies!

American govt. needs to do something but there are some politicians in the US who are connected. 

SBF was meeting with Gary Gensler from SEC. Is Gary corrupt? Probably yes!

SBF outsmarted everyone. It's like when you create a gang and he's holding his hands up in paradise saying, 'yeahh hey guys'

Americans need to put pressure on FBI, SEC, CFTC, Homeland SEcurity, to come down and get SBF.
