## Principles
The DAO Wei is my attempt to formalize the philosophy of DAOs. This is continually evolving as DAOs are shaped. 


## How can these principles be useful?
I believe that DAOs are the future of work. More people will contribute to DAOs, earning tokens as rewards. 

It is important to [design token economies well](/CCS/Useful%20metaphors%20to%20design%20token%20economies.md) to incentivize early adopters. As an early adopter of DAOs, you can get a lot of upside.
