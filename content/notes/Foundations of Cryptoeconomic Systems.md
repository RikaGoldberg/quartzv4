## Highlights
Using the same term in different contexts leads to different meanings and communication breakdowns when trying to come up with a general purpose definition of that term. This paper explores why the term “cryptoeconomics” is context dependent and proposes complementary micro, meso and macro definitions of the term. These context dependent definitions build on the perspectives outlined in this paper regarding the nature of cryptoeconomic systems such as the Bitcoin Network, and provides a foundation for further research in the area of cryptoeconomic systems.

Complex systems differ from other systems, in that the system behaviour cannot be easily inferred from the state changes induced by network actors (Parrott and Lange, 2013). Modeling approaches that ignore such difficulties will produce models that are not useful for modeling and steering those system.

Properties such as emergence, nonlinearity, adaptation, spontaneous order, and feedback loops are typical to complex systems (Bar-Yam, 2002). Complex systems research draws contributions from various scientific domains such as mathematics, biology, physics, psychology, meteorology, sociology, economics, and engineering (Parrott and Lange, 2013) which all contribute to complexity science, leveraging both analysis and synthesis; analytic processes reduce systems to better understand their parts, whereas synthesis is required to understand the whole as greater than the sum of its parts

Cryptoeconomic networks are adaptive because their behaviour adjusts in response to their environment, either directly in the case of the Bitcoin difficulty controller or more broadly through decisions on the part of node operators. Cryptoeconomic networks are multi-scale because they are specified by local protocols but are defined by their macro-scale properties, as is the case with the local “no double spend” rule guaranteeing a globally conserved token supply (Zargham, Zhang and Preciado, 2018). Their design requires a strong interdisciplinary approach to develop resilient protocols that account for their spatial and temporal dynamics of those networks (Liaskos, Wang and Alimohammadi, 2019).

A natural path forward is to treat cryptoeconomic systems as cyberphysical systems and to approach them with the diligence an engineer must afford to any public infrastructure (Hou et al., 2015). As with other complex engineered systems, informed governance requires both specialized tools and expertise, so even when governance systems are polycentric the parties responsible for governance are accountable to public they serve (Walch, 2015)(Ostrom, 2010). To do so, it is necessary to develop a holistic perspective for cryptoeconomic systems which relates the locally implemented protocols, behavioral response to those mechanisms and the systemic properties that emerge therefrom.
