### Highlights

**I’m not interested in independence for its own sake. I’m interested in inventing environments which significantly expand what people can think and do.…**

That aspiration is what drives my work, rather than a particular title, role, or practice…

When I use phrases like “independent researcher” to describe my work, the title is a loosely-held shorthand for what I really value: freedom of inquiry

These observations are necessarily quite personal, but I hope they’ll be of interest or use to others considering similar paths.…

For that matter, I’m skeptical that “independent researcher” is a stable or desirable long-term identity.…

In my case, the aspiration isn’t just to solve the object problem of, say, forgetting what you read…

I want to more deeply understand the properties of enabling environments—principles of operation, design procedures and patterns, relationship to individual and social cognition—[to foster a community which routinely invents new environments of this kind](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

Field creation will almost certainly involve institution creation. But my understanding is too weak right now to see much further.…

I understand theories by making software, and I live in San Francisco, so people often expect that I’m planning to launch a startup. But my interests are misaligned with [a startup’s fundamental drive: growth](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html). I’m interested in generating insight, not in generating growth, except insofar as growth is necessary to understanding the ideas I’m trying to explore.

Cutting-edge graphics research enables new kinds of storytelling, which in turn funds more research.…

A steady loop like Pixar’s is quite rare.…

You also need to explain why marginal insight remains an ongoing prerequisite to marginal business, rather than a “nice to have” which can be cut when…

To be sure, many startups do uncover fundamental insights, but usually as an inconsistent means, rather than as an end.…

You need a specific theory about why a given business model is connected to a given type of insight generation.…

since novel interface ideas are typically public goods.…

Their development might require significant investment, but once created they can often be copied cheaply by others, limiting returns to the inventor.…

basic scientists motivated purely by discovery.…

But so long as I have some persuasive theory of how that impact could happen, I prefer to focus on producing insight through prototypes…

“ideas are cheap; execution is what matters.”…

They tend to die if they tackle a niche which continuously demands both outstanding execution and also deep, original insight.…

ech culture is different from research culture, and I’m already quite overweight on tech culture. Anyone working in an industry for a while tends to a…

For example, tech culture is calibrated to a much faster pace than research culture. A “huge project” for a Silicon Valley tech person may be a year o…

Persistence with a difficult problem may require tens of hours for a tech person and hundreds (or thousands) of hours for a researcher, no matter how…

It’s not that the tech people are constitutionally lazy or something like that: in industry, it usually is, in fact, a bad idea to spend many hundreds…

Coming from the tech industry, my expectations around the pace of progress are often seriously miscalibrated for many problems I’m tackling. I’ll feel…

But the real reason is my choice of field. My goals, values, and practices align poorly with the academic discipline which would most naturally host m…

That’s a dispassionate way to put it. A subjective and inflammatory way to put it is that I feel academic HCI discourages vision and imagination.…

Part of the trouble seems to be that the field’s trying too hard to be a science. It emphasizes an empirical approach, often producing elaborate artif…

The field disincentivizes building systems significant enough to explore new paradigms; published systems are rarely driven by a serious context of u…

I read the major conferences’ proceedings every year, yet I learn much more about HCI from studying game designers and idiosyncratic Twitter tinkerers…

But if all professors really operated according to this one’s belief, we can see the problem that would be induced. The entire field would consist of…

I criticize academic HCI not out of ill will but out of genuine perplexity. I honestly don’t understand why the field behaves as it seems to behave. I…

Maybe the problem is that I’m actually trying to start a field which doesn’t exist yet, so of course HCI looks misaligned. Maybe this is my version of…

So I work independently. Not because that’s an ideal arrangement, but because I don’t see a good alternative. I don’t yet know how to create or join a…

In fact, I don’t understand yet my own projects well enough to effectively coordinate a large team around them, though I could certainly put a few mo…

Less than two years later, my patrons have crowdfunded roughly a graduate student’s fellowship grant. It’s not lucrative, but it’s enough to cover my…

I find that I have only so much room for taking risks. **When I can reduce the risk in some places in my life, I can more easily face risk in other area. I provide myself the courage to do some things by reducing my need for courage in other areas.

This certainly matches my experience, not just with Patreon but with marriage, home ownership, investments in well-being, and so on.…

**At Khan Academy, we were often quite dependent on a small number of huge-value donors, and we’d regularly fret about appeasing them; when one would decline to offer another grant, it would create tremendous stress. The “grassroots” situation creates a much healthier interpersonal relationship with funders, some of whom are personal friends—I’d hate for anyone to feel like they need to keep funding me out of some sense of guilt.**

**Unlike a typical paid newsletter or blog, funder-exclusive writing is a secondary by-product of my primary work. In this way, I’m not a traditional “content creator.” 

**Sometimes I catch myself thinking in terms of what I’ll write or report next to my funders. That’s not good. Such a mindset, taken too seriously, encourages shallower work designed to appease others. 

**Also, I’m human, so I naturally want to report successes. But this can create the same pressures which exist in scientific publishing: short-term-ism, conservatism, publication bias, harmful over-claiming.

**In research, it’s terribly important that you be brutally honest with yourself. I don’t think it’s possible to craft marketing-like messages about your “great progress” without closing your own eyes to what’s actually happening—which means you’d better be brutally honest when talking to others about your work.**

As an antidote, I’ve tried to engage in what Michael has called “anti-marketing”. **That is, to make a point of focusing publicly on the _least_ rosy parts of my projects—what’s confusing, what’s frustrating, what’s not working. It’s hard to do consistently, but when anti-marketing is the goal, then interesting challenges become something positive: useful fodder for public conversation, rather than something to be swept under the rug. I suspect it also builds a deeper, more authentic relationship with an audience.**

**More broadly, I’ve experimented this year with a mindset I’ve been calling “working with the garage door up.” I try to share rough, ongoing artifacts  from my process, including [the working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) where I do most of my daily thinking. This has worked quite well when I adopt the right mindset—that I’m sharing objects made as part of my primary work, rather than things created specifically for publication.**

**The practice generates more conversation and serendipitous inbounds “for free.” It’s worth noting that in most ways, unusual inbounds are a better leading indicator for my work than page views or other more traditional metrics. Popular projects might garner a lot more mass attention but a lot _less_ attention from unusual, singular people. Those people often introduce surprising (and more meaningful) insights and opportunities.

**Apart from potential distraction and distortion, there’s another subtle issue with talking to a broad audience about ongoing research. The clearest, most familiar parts of your ideas are the ones which you’ll have the easiest time communicating and which your conversation partner will have the easiest time grasping. Often, those elements are already somewhat mainstream or even clichéd. Others are likely to have lots of cached thoughts around such ideas, and they’ll tend to be interpreted incrementally.**

But if you’re doing something original, the most interesting aspects are the ones which others—and you!—understand least well.…

Particularly early on, you may not be able to articulate the new element you’re reaching for very clearly. It may just sound like an unusual adverb ch…

Others’ replies will tend to emphasize the most mainstream elements, since they may not notice or know how to react to the aspects you least understan…

Great colleagues and collaborators can take more active steps to mitigate the issue. For instance, if Michael hears me talking about some idea that se…

Unfortunately, I’m not yet sure how to avoid the regression problem when discussing ideas regularly with a broad audience.…

From this angle, it may make more sense to think of the production of the work itself as a product. What are patrons buying when they buy that product…

Perhaps without that patron’s contribution, the creator must spend some of their time freelancing to pay the bills, so their projects were limited in…

About a third framed their funding in terms of “people, not projects,” expressing general confidence that I’ll do interesting work. Naturally, that’s…

How repeatable is my modest success with crowdfunding? Could others follow this path? I can’t know, of course, but it’s worth articulating some of the…

First and foremost, I was in a position financially to draw no income for (as originally planned) several years. In terms of the general population, t…

My wife’s generous understanding was unusual and essential. Practically speaking, though, it helps that she’s a doctor. Having trained from 2011 throu…

It’s a fairly ideal situation financially, except for the San Francisco part.…

I should mention that there was another straightforward path for me (and for many other tech workers) which wouldn’t have required crowdfunding at all…

While I’d planned to live without income, I avoided burning through savings by becoming the lucky recipient of an Emergent Ventures grant. It covered…

My past experiences have also yielded essential social capital. Most people don’t seem to care that I’m unaffiliated, but I suspect that’s only becaus…

Along the same lines, my past work and writing has accumulated a modest but substantial online audience. I don’t need an academic journal or publisher…

This same network is the source of most of my patrons. I don’t think I could have recruited this audience of funders without Twitter—at least not with…
