This is a summary with learnings and takeaways of this week's growth/fundraising blurb. 

The Tokenomics call with the Token Engineering Team shed light on the ways in which player incentives and rewards can be improved (by modeling) to create a sustainable system that will hopefully last a long time and will keep the price of $Seed stable and, hopefully, trending up with time. 

The token engineers encouraged us to conduct a few legal audits during the fundraising process to ensure we are in compliance with regulation. Selling a token to investors is, of course, a sensitive legal matter because of securities laws. We really need to be thoughtful about the information we share with potential investors and the public. 

For purposes of ETHPorto, I think it's wise to not talk about the fundraise (especially because unlike ETHDenver, these will be mostly new folks, so trust would not be established yet.) 

Instead my goals are to:
1. Attend the hackathon and introduce MetaGame to new people, attracting new players by explaining our play-to-earn model and why they should join us. 
2. Find different "blockchain investors" who would be interested in MG's tokens & good fits. *See below note about the 9 types of blockchain gamers*
	1. Angel investors/ crypto whales (would be interesting to attend private events where these people will be -- need to reach out to organizers), early adopters,  and get them excited about MetaGame's in-game utility (*note: will need to do so thoughtfully given the legal constraints of the fundraise)
	- Note: For more context see [The 9 Types of Blockchain Gamers](/notes/The%209%20Types%20of%20Blockchain%20Gamers.md)
3. Find potential new sponsors for MetaMedia (newsletter, podcast, Youtube) + possibly even sell ad space
	- This is an interesting opportunity to find sponsors outside of Meta Fam, new and different projects. 
	- Aligned with my broader goals outlined here: https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/rika-goldberg-to-champion-metamedia/1052

Ultimately, I will follow in Peth's lead fundraising at ETHDenver. Many insights will emerge that will impact my strategy going into ETHPorto.
