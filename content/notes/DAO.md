# What tis a DAO?
## TL;DR
DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. This is not super helpful for understanding, so silly me proposes we call DAOs: [YODA](/notes/YODA.md). It's more fun this [wei](/notes/DAO%20Wei.md)

DAOs enable people to organize to achieve a shared mission, and are possible because of the trustless nature of Ethereum that permits groups of strangers who meet on the Internet to:

1.  **create and maintain a transparent and shared treasury**
    
2.  **submit proposals for how to spend treasury monies (e.g., pay members, fundraise, give grants)**
    
3.  **cast an immutable vote yay/nay for a proposal**
    
4.  **experiment with emergent, non-hierarchical organizational structures and create models for the future of work**
    
5.  **have fun**

## DAOs as a system

Everyone is curious about what exactly a DAO is and a lot of people attempt to label it with a label they already know. For example, a DAO is a club with a shared bank account or a DAO is a co-op or a DAO is a decentralized entity. 

Yes. A DAO may be all of the above, but I argue that, most important, a DAO is a [system](/notes/Systems%20thinking.md) with [emergence] as a core property. 

When learning about a DAO, it's helpful to play the role of Alice in Wonderland. You want to be curious and you want to be surprised.

At the crux of what a DAO tis, a DAO is a community..a community of people who know and like each other. You have to be a member, unlike let's say Facebook or Instagram where no vetting is required. So in a sense, yeah, DAOs are exclusionary. But it's not really that...they're just curated communities. In the same way that a university selects students. 

Communities are super important. DAOs are a vehicle for changing the world towards what we want to see. I have found that people who gravitate towards DAOs are people who are disillusioned by Silicon Valley tech.

Corporations used to be the default way to bring people together, pool, and allocate resources. Society relied on the structure of corporations to bring people together and give them money and resources to solve problems in society. Today, we also have DAOs to serve this function. Society relies on DAOs to coordinate groups of people and give them money and resources so they can solve problems. DAOs enable a fairer system by aligning incentives better than corporations, resulting in more people acquiring wealth while working on problems that they care about with people whom they care about.
