**My very raw thoughts**

**#1 IMO, play the long game. Long Now Foundation agrees. This means focus on mental health. No one wants to be Richard from Silicon Valley, but we see that.** 

Ambitious people want to achieve great things. It seems to be a common thread. After surveying my family and friends, all of whom are ambitious, (why do I only surround myself with ambitious people, or is there some bias at play? idk...) Anyway, back to the topic. 

**Few people actually know what to do to be great, and end up focusing on the wrong thing, paying attention to the wrong thing, and being out of touch with reality.** 

Let's look at the research of modern day successful people (like Andy Matuschak and Paul Graham just as a starting point).

Right now, you will just read quotes but I plan to eventually turn these quotes into a cohesive synthesis to **prove my argument that successful people do things that most people would think are counterproductive to success.** 

Peek into my thought rabbit hole:
