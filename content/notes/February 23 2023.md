I attended an insightful Tokenomics call with the Token Engineering team that helped me to better understand the incentives/rewards structure within MetaGame. Albeit I have more questions than answers now. 

Questions:
- What is the ask from investors at this point? Is it to buy $Seeds? Now or after the token sale? (Taking money from investors now will be like a token sale, but buying seeds is not??)

Goals of conference:
- Meeting Players
- Spreading the word about MetaGame
- Inviting people to Discord
