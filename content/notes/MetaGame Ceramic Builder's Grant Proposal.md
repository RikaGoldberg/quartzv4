**Ceramic Ecosystem Value Proposition:**

-   _What is the **problem statement** this proposal hopes to solve for the Ceramic ecosystem? How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Ceramic ecosystem?_
	-   We’ve been building on top of 3Box/IDX/Ceramic for almost 3 years now. We’ve been promoting it to everyone along the way & will continue to do so. We have a very popular marketing channel in our newsletter with over 10k subscribers.
	- **We aim to come up with standardized, composable models for profile-related data for any apps building on top of Ceramic to be able to use**
	-  Over 1,600 web3 citizens have created MyMeta profiles (with 100% organic growth), making us one of the biggest profile-related projects utilizing Ceramic
	-  Rather than just using Ceramic as a single “decentralized identity solution”, we want to use it to **create universal schemas & plug in other major identity solutions such as Lens or ENS, making it into a decentralized identity aggregator**
	
**Milestones:**
-   Milestone #0: Building w/ 3Box, [self.id 1](http://self.id/) and Ceramic for 3 years, enduring breaking changes that delayed our launches twice, then screwed up our launches twice more, spending over $100k in the process & never giving up. (Completed) - [$0]
-   Milestone #1: ComposeDB Upgrades (Feb 2023) - [$20,900]
    -   Translate our existing **profile-related data models** into more granular models, coordinating with other profile-related projects along the way [20 hours @ $110 / hr]
    -   Upgrade our existing Ceramic node (ceramic.metagame.wtf) to be ComposeDB compatible. Set up a database to allow indexing as specified in the docs [40 hours @ $110 / hr]
    -  Build a data export / import tool for users to be able to **port their existing profiles over to the new system.** Test, troubleshoot and maintain the tool for ~6 months after launch. [50 hours @ $110 / hr]
    -  Upgrade MyMeta to use the ComposeDB graphQL queries and mutations - [80 Hours @ $110 / hr]
-   Milestone #2: MyMeta Integrations (Feb 2023) - [$21,450]
    -   Improved MyMeta performance through caching of Hasura external schemas - [15 Hours @ $110 / hr]
    -   Build out more functionality for **pulling in DAO memberships of existing MyMeta users, through data sources like DAOHaus**. This will fill in some data gaps, data that we can eventually put on Ceramic for other apps to use as well - [60 Hours @ $110 / hr]
    -  Add profile pictures into the creation flow & revamp the quick edit menu - [30 Hours @ $110 / hr]
    -   Integrate ENS - [20 Hours @ $110 / hr]
    -  Add MyMeta profile &/or MetaOS dashboard “custom block” integrations for two other projects utilizing Ceramic / ComposeDB to pull in users’ shared data - [70 Hours @ $110 / hr]
-   Milestone #3: Coordination with related ecosystem projects (Feb 2023) - [$3,250]
    -   **Resurrect the web3 profiles Telegram working group and coordinate with other reputation and identity protocols about integration with MyMeta** [40 Hours @ $50 / hr]
    -  **Help platform projects & DAOs integrate Ceramic-based profiles into their platforms.** A follow-up to Milestone 1 action item 1. [20 Hours @ $50 / hr]
    -  **Write a post about the integration & go on promoting Ceramic to every identity or reputation provider that could be plugged in as well as Web3 platforms that might benefit from integrating decentralized profiles for their users.** - [5 Hours @ $50 / hr]
