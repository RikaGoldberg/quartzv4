Floating and wandering through DAOs - mostly by reading, Telegram discussions, and one-off contributions to MetaCartel -- my curiosities are: 

- tokenomics (design of token systems to fund public goods)
	- systems design 
- governance (ensuring diverse, one-off voices are heard and get measurable impact, even by people who would previously not contribute)
- writing lore
