Proposal:
https://forum.daohaus.club/t/grant-application-dao-storytelling/10954

**Next Steps**
DAOCollective Article on Governance. 
Also includes Kelsie Nabben's work. And Zargham's. 
Systems thinking/emergent systems. 
Focus on technical stuff. Remember audience is thoughtful MetaCartel and related people. 

I'm working on this writing project for MGD as part of YODA, a DAO Anthology. So fun. 

I can't believe I barely highlighted in the book. I have an aversion to future is feminine type of people. It seems superficial. I don't want this book to be superficial. The stories should be deep. Very deep. How do we do that? How can I create deep books that are less about hey, this is the DAO look at it it's so great and more about 'hey mgd is cool because...'

There are so many DAOs that are female focused and business led but I am writing about MGD because it is one that I associate with as it is part of MGD. 

I honestly have no idea what they are working on tho or why people should care. Not everyone will care. The audience for MGD, for this story, is MetaFam people. There are all of these quarters/niches/areas of interest. And people who read this content will care. 

**The first step is identifying the audience. MGD people. Systems thinkers. People who care about the ins and outs of DAOs. How they work. About **governance.** Contracts. Moloch DAOs. Fundraising. History of governance contracts.** 

What if I were to write a piece about SheFi? What if i related to that community and I was like darn I want to write about the wonderful women there doing what ..community building? 


This quote from [The Patriarchs, Angela Saini; Quotes](/books/The%20Patriarchs,%20Angela%20Saini/The%20Patriarchs,%20Angela%20Saini;%20Quotes.md) caught my attention this morning as a good one to include potentially in the story's opening. Because no two DAOs are exactly the same, no fossils of how DAOs are organized, they each have a level of personality and creativity from founders and members, attracting specific types of people. MGD has its own flare. Genuino in Porto had its own flare too. Restaurants, homes, spaces. It's all a reflection of their owner. 

“The trouble with the entire line of reasoning employed by Johann Jakob Bachofen in 1861, then Lewis Morgan and Friedrich Engels soon after him, is that, as the anthropologist Adam Kuper notes in his book The Invention of Primitive Society, human societies don’t all necessarily trace back to one single point, to a time when everyone lived the same way. We may be able to draw some common threads, writes Kuper, but there are no “fossils of social organization.”
