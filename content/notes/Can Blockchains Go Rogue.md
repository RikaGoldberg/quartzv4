The core feature of tokenized ecosystems (aka public blockchains) is *getting people to do stuff.* It's getting the right incentives. 

Without the right incentives, Bitcoin can go rogue, like the classic AI paperclips maximizer thought experiment by [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom). 

- What happened is an AI that was programmed to make as many paperclips as possible decided to optimize its goal by eliminating humans because humans could block the AI from its goal by turning the AI off. 

- The problem is the AI missed a key constraint: don't destroy humanity. 

- Let's say humanity starts to get destroyed. Some people say, "just turn off the AI!" Yes, but that won't work if the AI is decentralized. 

Incentives = make people do stuff by rewarding them with tokens. 

Ralph Merkle wrote about [Bitcoin as life](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf):

> Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. … It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted.

Recall Bitcoin’s block rewards function (aka objective function): maximize security, by maximizing hash rate, by maximizing electricity usage. And it’s optimizing against that objective remarkably “well.” So well that it is [on track to overtake USA by July 2019](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-guzzles-energyand-its-carbon-footprint-just-keeps-growing/). And energy is perhaps the most important resource on earth. It’s the thing we humans start wars over. (Oil, remember?)

Satoshi almost certainly didn’t mean to suck the life force out of the planet. Objective function design aka incentive design is _hard_. But we have to try! To do a good job, we need solid engineering theory, practice, and tools. That is, _token engineering_.
