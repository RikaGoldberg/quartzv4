**The hard core of the concept is, in my opinion, that of conditionality. As soon as the relation between two entities A and B becomes conditional on C's value or state than a necessary component of "organization" is present.**

**The converse is reducability (or separability)**

pg. 4
The treatment of conditionality (whether by functions of many variables, by correlation analysis, by uncertainty analysis, or by other ways) makes us realize that the essential idea is that there is first a product space - that of the *possibilities* - within which some subset of points indicates the actualities. This way of looking at "conditionality" makes us realize that it is related to that of "communication"; and it is, of course, quite plausible that we should define parts as being "organized" when "communication" occurs between them. (Again the natural converse is that of independence, which represents non-communication).

**"Thus the presence of organization between variables is equivalent to the existence of a constraint in the product-space of the possibilities."**

**I stress this point because while in the past biologists have tended to think of organization as something extra, something added to the elementary variables, the modern theory, based on the logic of communication, regards organization as a restriction or constraint.** The two points of view are thus diametrically opposed; there is no question of either being exclusively right, for each can be appropriate in its context. But with this opposition in existence we must clearly go carefully, especially when we discuss with others, lest should we fall into complete confusion. 

Organization theory. 

The real world gives the subset of what is; the product space represents the uncertainty of the observer.** 

The constraint is thus a relation between observer and thing; the properties of any particular constraint will depend on both the real thing and on the observer.** 

It follows that a substantial part of the theory of organization will be concerned with properties that are not intrinsic to the thing but are relational between observer and thing
