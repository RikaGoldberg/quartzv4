**The darkness**

I used to get overwhelmed and think I was a failure when I had a bunch of [unfinished drafts](notes/Unfinished%20drafts.md) but I now realize I was wrong. Ideas need time to percolate. Books need time to percolate, too. And sometimes you pick up a book and it's just not the right time. It's okay! What is important is to have a space to have the ideas percolate. Like a digital garden. So go ahead and [fork this garden](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) 

**The light**

I also have [Finished drafts](/notes/Finished%20drafts.md)
It's a yin and yang kind of thing that keeps me whole.
