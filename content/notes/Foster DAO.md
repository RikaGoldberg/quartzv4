[Foster](https://www.foster.co/), a collective for Writers, YC21. 

### Co-writing
* Foster DAOs specialty is co-writing. 

* Co-writing is uniquely enabled by Web3 technology. 

* Writers can earn co-ownership and governance rights. 

### Progressive Decentralization 

* Members earn THANKS for contributing writing and editing. 
* Contributors can endorse/vote on essays so writers can get funding from the treasury and contribute to the Foster publication.
* Eventually, Foster wants to support writers with editorial, grants, programs, distribution, etc, built on top of Foster's collaborative writing protocol.
