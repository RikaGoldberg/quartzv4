[Foster writing community](https://www.foster.co/) is working on becoming a DAO. 

## April 14 2021 Meeting Notes
-  Let’s foster a playful mindset that will allow for emergence and convergence, before we start to work
    
**Q&A**:

- Q: How do we get moving? 
-   A: We need to start with governance and decide on a selection process for new DAO members. It may not be fair to talk about essay topics/truths without more members.
	-  Or not. We can also spend a few more weeks riffing on ideas. 
	
- Q: What is the scope of the DAO? Will it be separate from the original Foster community? Is the DAO the administrative arm of the Foster community
-   A: Yes, sounds like the DAO will be a separate entity under Foster the company. 

- Q: What ideas do we have for essay topics?
-   A: Humaning advice for next gen
     A: Real stories of people doing mundane things that end up changing their life trajectory
    A: Interview one another to share someone else’s story
- Q: Why are we investing in collaborative essays?
    -  A: Because it’s aligned with Foster’s mission to change the current online content creation paradigm (currently, the paradigm incentivizes full-time content creators and a select few dominant voices) to a paradigm where more voices, more diverse voices, are heard.
        A: Our current system incentivizes full-time creators. We are missing out on the vast middle ground of people who don’t have the time/money to be full-time creators. We want to share their stories. 
        A: We want people to discover their truth barometer

-   Q: What if we fund a theme/month?
-   A: Cool. Yes.

-  Q: What if we do themed essays and have writers team up?
	- A: Maybe. (We didn’t really talk about this). 
    
-  Q: How do we create a process/mechanism to propose essay ideas and get people onboarded?
    - A: We didn’t really cover this.
    
**Other**
 - First treasury gets funded (money needs to be sent from bank account to multisig wallet). Then decide who gets NFT as membership. Then THANKS token. 
 - Progressive decentralization
 
 
## April 7 2021 Meeting Notes

### Diversity & Inclusion 
- Write 100 collaborative essays together. 
- Redefine foster's value prop to be more attractive to diverse audiences. 

### NFT essays
- Writers have a corner on the Internet that new audiences/investors/customers can keep on discovering
- Learn about the buyers so we can turn it into a sustainable model

### Technical voting and governance
- Form a tech pod to learn about blockchain tech to use
- Explainer video document
- Rob, Padmini, Rika, Dan

### Collaborative Essays
- Yay or no? Sounds possibly too complex
- Need to think about composability 

P.S. How do people get paid? (put in a proposal)
