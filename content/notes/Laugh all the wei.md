> A cynic is a (wo)man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.
	-   Oscar Wilde, Irish poet and playwright
    
A cynic’s complaint about MetaFactory may come in a flavor like this: 

“MetaFactory’s products are way overpriced! Sneakers and t-shirts for $200, get out of here…it’s so not worth the price..”

To us - the optimists -it is clear that the cynic is focusing exclusively on price and is not asking why (See Principle #2 for a refresher on asking why questions). 

Cynics, pessimists, and haters (call negative people as you wish) are easy to find in the world. Crypto has become yet another easy target for them.

But, we, optimists, DAO believers who are building a [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk#:~:text=Solarpunk%20is%20a%20literary%20genre,%2C%20climate%20change%2C%20and%20pollution.) future, can’t let the cynics get to us. They’re just a distraction from reaching our goals. 

Pessimists never changed the world; optimists have changed the world. And optimists are the ones who come up with radical ideas that initially may seem weird. 

Why is MetaFactory’s apparel so expensive?

The reason that MetaFactory’s apparel is so expensive is because MetaFactory produces quality apparel, with a hyper focus on sustainability and strict supplier and partner quality standards.

Suppliers who don’t meet these standards, or who are not aligned with MetaFactory’s mission and values, get [booted](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/metafactory-4-20-ted-talk/255)

Let’s do a thought experiment and laugh a little. 

### Devil Wears Prada

In the iconic film, The Devil Wears Prada, Meryl Streep’s character is a ruthless woman who runs a luxury fashion magazine. She’s mean, bossy, and cut-throat. 

Here is Meryl Streep, alongside a pair of devil pitchfork heels, the film’s logo:

If you have never seen what Drew and Hammad look like, you’re probably wondering…what do they look like? And if you have seen what they look like, you’re probably wondering…what the heck is going on right now? 

Lol. Things are going to get a little weird. Bear with me.

Let’s imagine that Merryl Streep isn’t a diva. What if she is warm and approachable? What if instead of stiletto heels, she repped shoes that looked like this:

[Shoes](https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/automata-sneakers) that were designed by an up-and-coming streetwear artist, printed to say “dORG”, and would soon come with a NFT wearable. 

If all of the above were true, she would be a…

Handsome, trendsetting, crypto economic wizard fashionista! Like Drew and Hammad (pictured below, respectively).

Okay, and, finally, let’s have one last laugh to demonstrate the principle of laugh all the wei.

I want to show you Prada’s ownership structure, as found in [Prada’s 2020 annual report](https://www.pradagroup.com/content/dam/pradagroup/documents/Shareholderinformation/2021/inglese/e-Annual%20Report%202020.pdf).**

**![prada annual report](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RmFx0VvcLfR1IZPswL2P0R92QUMAmPwQQLhWQcp9jsKQMpckGv6ObBNrxYjh9TP-ok-VbZLecNjbPSRONTk1Ef8ouY5HO_WPi9Xva3J6M1yDTggeop-g2oINGUnT0yqlI5B4TGMl)**

Prada is 80% owned and controlled by only two individuals, Miuccia Prada - Mario Prada’s granddaughter; and Patrizio Bertelli - a Tuscan entrepreneur who partnered with Miuccia in the 1970s to take Prada international.

It’s crazy, and maybe even surprising. Definitely laugh-worthy. 

Another fun, and maybe surprising decision, is that luxury brands like [Prada](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/crypto/adidas-originals-and-prada-announces-metaverse-and-an-nft-project-7736788/), [Balenciaga, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/01/17/5-brands-already-boldly-embracing-the-metaverse) have all recently entered the metaverse. 

Pragmatically, this makes sense.

Giant luxury brands have survived for over a century, some even for two centuries (in the case of Louis Vuitton), because of their tremendous foresight. They are always one step ahead of their competition. 

There’s a lesson to be learned here: luxury brands are entering the metaverse because they have foresight. However, even though luxury brands are ahead of their peers, they are laggards compared to MetaFactory.

MetaFactory has already, for several years, been building in the metaverse, using AR and VR to build new and fun realities. 

  
MetaFactory is also committed to designing an organizational structure aligned with the wei of nature - to be resilient to stress, adaptable to change, and emergent.

Most importantly, MetaFactory members have fun working.

As NFL Quarterback Drew Brees said:

>you can’t compete with someone having fun.

You also can’t compete with the wei of nature.
