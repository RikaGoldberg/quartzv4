## [Introducing Vector DAO. Crypto needs less investors and more… | by Vector DAO | Medium](https://medium.com/@vectorDAO/introducing-vector-dao-6eed7ff13aa6?curius=1599)

### Highlights
**Crypto needs less investors and more builders In the age of Wall Street Bets, tech IPOs, and token listings, the power of ownership in generating wealth is now well understood.** As a result, more and more people are choosing to invest instead of build. And we don’t blame them.

Vector DAO is a decentralized collective of designers, brand experts, and creatives pioneering a new way of working that tilts the scales back towards builders.

We’ve built new org structures that make it seamless for contributors to earn equity and tokens for their work. Being compensated in illiquid tokens can be risky so we protect our members by distributing the risks and upside of any one project **by pooling these tokens into a portfolio shared by all our members.**

**Wealth is generated not through selling time, but by owning assets with asymmetric payoff.**

Vector DAO only accepts equity or tokens as compensation in exchange for services provided. We’ve found that this aligns incentives between project and contributor significantly better. In startups, where speed and flexibility are critical, hourly compensation penalizes these qualities when we want to incentivize the exact opposite. Vector DAO handles the paperwork and legal structures required for our members to earn equity and token compensation. Members simply have to show up and start contributing.

**Today, acquiring ownership through work means betting years of your life on a single startup in the hopes it becomes a unicorn. Meanwhile, investors can build portfolios to diversify risk and increase exposure to multiple successful companies.**

The idea of 9 to 5 employment is a relic from the industrial era. Knowledge workers are like athletes, meant to sprint and recover.

Members sign up for the level of commitment they deem best for themselves. Vector DAO works with both full and part time contributors. If members choose to take time off and skip a season, that’s ok too. Unlike traditional startups, there’s no cliff with Vector DAO.
