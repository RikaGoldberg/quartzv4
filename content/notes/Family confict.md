#summary 

My family, as all families do, have a long history. We have aired out our dirty laundry with one another since I was young, although I never had the courage to do it. My mom didn't either. Because my dad is a real shmuk. A misogynist and a racist, I never was able to express myself. 

And an inability to express yourself is the worst thing ever. My dad taught me that. Except his mindset is so ass backwards because his self expression is always at someone else's expense. Whether it's a story about how stupid someone is, inside or outside the house, when anyone expressed themselves to him, they would get his wrath of dismissiveness and insult. The result is feeling god damn helpless.
