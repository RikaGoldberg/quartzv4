Mochi is a productivity app that uses gamification to incentivize behaviors. In its current version, it is implemented as a Discord bot. In order to play the game and earn rewards, players stake Eth and complete daily check-ins on Discord. Players' ETH is slashed for missed check-ins. The slashed ETH goes into a community fund --  members choose how to spend this ETH. 

Mochi [secured a grant with the Optimism Foundation](https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-mochi/3427) to top their coffers with OP tokens. Players earn 1 Mochi token and 3 OP tokens for each check-in.
