- Metafactory has a lot of diversity in the scope so working groups are really important. MF has backend traditional business element (merch apparel and fashion/product, LLC in background that is slave to the DAO) selling services and products. 

  - Has a service DAO element. 

  - Administrative/business development. 

  - Can’t have open door policy when it comes to bank account, credit cards, etc. Speedy. 

  - More experimental fashion side & designers (e.g, Wes and berlin microfactory). Can operate self sufficiently on their own accord. 

  - Use Figma, Arena

  **What are the working groups? **

	1.  Berlin microfactory
    
	2. Working Design
    
	3. Admin/Bus Dev. 
    
	4. NYC microfactory with decode & fulfillment
    
	5. Development 
    
	6. Digital XR Metaverse. More open. Metafactory & friends. Trying to connect DAOs. Bridge between Web3 DAOs and 
    
	7. Core team (most active, most aware of operations)
    
Working groups emerged fairly early out of necessity. Started as just two (first group bus. dev/admin) then people experimenting coming up with drops (2nd group). Dev was its own probably too. 

**Are there leaders?**
Drew is leader of admin/bus. Dev. Nifty50 & DAOFren is the other leader. 
Developer - Metadreamer  
Berlin - Wes
Fashion is more open. 
NY – Ben is the lead.

**Do working groups affect compensation?**

Token distribution is based on sales revenue for the dao. 
Buyer rewards
Design for product drops
Ops budget 
Started to look into UBI for people doing critical roles
Working groups good because value distribution with coordinape is good. 

If you get too big, like 100 contributors, the less reliable peer to peer mechanics operate. 

**How do you keep people on the same page?** 
- Weekly meetings

No two DAOs are the same. For DAOs that are focused on a core tenet and mission and you need insight on what everyone is working on, and a tighter scope, working groups are no good. 
Working groups help eliminate redundancy
Working groups are more focused. Can have their own KPIs. Understand the amount of work 
Working groups are definitely a necessity!

Sometimes out of necessity, some people need to wear many hats & work across working groups. Work like an information lifeline to give updates across the groups, like a bridge. Those people are at risk of burnout especially if the scope is too big. Want to make sure people aren’t spread too thin. 

**How is information communicated across the working groups?**

– Documentation (setting good habits). Aka designated scholars. Set good practices for people documenting what is happening. Jin uses HackMD. Use Notion too. Source of truth for project management to products is in Notion. Manufacturing partners/blanks. Still have it but have been experimenting with dework and sobol
