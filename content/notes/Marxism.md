A political philosophy that believes there is class conflict between the bourgeoise (middle class) who own the mean sof production & the proletariat (workers). 

Marx believed that, eventually, through education and personal development the workers would better understand the systems they live in and devise ways of changing it. 

Such radical change, Marx believed, could only come about through revolution where the workers would rise up and overthrow the bourgeoise. 

In place of capitalism, a new system would be established where all people would be treated equally and all factories and businesses would be communally owned. He called this system communism.
