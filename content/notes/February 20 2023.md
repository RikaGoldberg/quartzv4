I started my rabbit hole journey today into MetaGame's
[tokenomics](notes/Token%20Engineering%20Fundamentals%20Course.md). It's important thatI have an understanding of the fundamentals so that I can explain the value to potential patrons who I meet at ETHPorto. Furthermore, I want to participate in MetaGame's token economy, dog fooding the project that I am contributing to by staking a portion of the Seeds that I earn each month. This "play to earn" model is what MetaGame and, more broadly, Web3 is all about. The coolest thing is that I get rewarded for learning and I "level-up" by creating more value (on both the individual and the project level) using my acquired knowledge. Taking it one step further, token economies in Web3, unlike in Web2, are interconnected. This means that tokens from different projects are constantly impacting each other. The whole ethos of Web3 is positive sum and collaborative, rather than zero sum and extractive. Tokenomics plays a super important role in the health of Web3.

Today, I learned that MetaGame has two pools on [Balancer](/notes/Balancer.md). One is on [Mainnet](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xea05a15dbce2eb543ffda16950e95b2bd2e40d0e/swaps) and one is on [Polygon](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x8a8fcd351ed553fc75aecbc566a32f94471f302e000100000000000000000081). In the interest of not fragmenting liquidity, the team wants to deactivate the mainnet pool (it has less liquidity than the Polygon pool). The blocker, however, is that MetaDreamer is the controller of the [Mainnet contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x414Edccf87399c0D14a23A3A869Aa3c84b23D63a#writeContract). I have pinged him to ask to transfer ownership to MetaGame's mainnet multisig. Once he does this, we can turn off swaps on the mainnet contract, which in effect will dis-incentivize liquidity providers from keeping funds in that contract. The happiest scenario is that the LPs will withdraw their funds from Mainnet and add that liquidity to the Polygon Balancer Pool.

Tomorrow, I will continue the rabbit hole and review the latest [pitch deck](https://www.figma.com/file/n36ggiRBQEGzRUbGxWfkMX/Meta-Game-(Copy)?node-id=7687%3A7311&t=0TK5EC6PgKQuEy8V-1)
