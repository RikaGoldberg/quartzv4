Without mirrors or photographs, I would struggle to take stock of the evolution of my physical features—my outer self. Without art, I would struggle to take stock of the evolution of the knowledge, lessons, and emotional faculties I have managed to accrue and hone over the years—my inner self.

Not only do books, movies, songs, plays, poems, and essays allow me to get a sense of where and who I am, they also allow me to get a sense of where and who I’ve been. Every time I read, watch, or listen to quality art for the second, third, or tenth time, it seems to change. And if perception is the product of object and observation, a change in perception implies a change in observer—an evolution of self.

Accumulating experience is the precursor for personal evolution, but is not personal evolution itself. Experience serves as the basis for reflection. The highest-quality art then serves as the highest-resolution mirrors—providing the reflections upon which real transformation might occur.

Watching Good Will Hunting this weekend allow me to internalize many of the lessons I have (inadvertently) managed to accumulate over the past several years. Furthermore, watching it every year on my birthday will allow me to document my personal evolution from year to year. My reactions, thoughts, takeaways, and reflections each time I watch Good Will Hunting will serve as still-frames of my current emotional, intellectual, and spiritual self.

Books are like mirrors, you only see in them what you already have inside you.

If you asked me why seven-year-olds shouldn’t read Shakespeare, I would tell you it’s because they haven’t had enough life experiences (nor have they developed the faculty to integrate their life experiences in a way that is novel, narrative, and/or unique), for Shakespeare’s poetry or plays to mean anything to them.

Most seven-year-olds have never experienced love, loss, regret, or betrayal. And it is precisely because of this lack of life experience that if you were to hold up one of Shakespeare’s plays in front of them, the metaphorical mirror would not reflect a whole lot of anything.

I hope to genuinely be amused by the prior year’s version of myself each time another birthday rolls around. Anything short of that would be a failure, for as a good friend likes to remind me often—if you’re not embarrassed by the version of yourself from a year ago, you’re not moving fast enough.

So as I have more experiences and begin to know more of life, I have increasingly begun looking to authors, screenwriters, musicians, and directors to tell me through their craft what I didn’t know that I knew.
