"Good strategy needs a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action."
- Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

"The kernel is a list reminding us that a good strategy has, at a minimum,
three essential components: a diagnosis of the situation, the choice of an overall guiding policy, and the design of coherent action."
- Richard Rumelt, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

1) The **diagnosis**: I am scrambling to make Opolis payments every two weeks because I don't have enough crypto cash on hand. 
2) The choice of an overall **guiding policy**: I need to determine the level of portfolio risk that I am comfortable with (currently, in bear market so probably conservative) and then determine token allocation percentages
	1) I need a runway
3) The design of coherent **action**: I will sell some tokens now (ones I deem as shitcoins; list out thoughtful reasons for why) and they increase to a certain price
