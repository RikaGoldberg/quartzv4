DAOs are like global nation states. They are building economies using traditional means - from land reform, immigration policy, protection of local industry, currency protection, special economic zones, and tax incentives.Â 

DAO alliances are really important for building the DAO economy and these alliances are closer to nation state alliances than corporate M&A. 

DAOs are successful when other DAOs win too, so collaborations will involve product integrations, sharing or resources, support during attacks, and increase in economic value of both DAOs. 

Exchanges of assets between DAOs becomes very important.
