I woke up at 820am. I meditated on the balcony. Imade coffee and spilled beans LOL. Oh well, everything is already broken, amiright?

I wrote an About newsletter that I love. I went to yoga. Mario was awesome. He said "your ego is not your amigo." Made me think of Danny. 

I wrote an excellent newsletter post. Cathartic and meaningful. I defined a direction for my newsletter. 

Therapy was emotionally meaningful. Take care of yourself, Kelly told me.
