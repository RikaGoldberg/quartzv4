Notes: 

**No Respect

This chapter was weird. He talks about power and respect. Power is assymetrical - one person with a fell swoop commands something, and others listen and do quitely, opening up space. Respect is not assymetrical e.g, a ruler can respect the people he rules. 

He says distance is the problem with the Internet. There is no distance, and nothing is private. Privacy is gone. People wave their lives on the Internet with social media, creating no boundaries. This just creates scandal. 

**He is an advocate for power and respect, where one person, or maybe a group of people, act like role models.** 

He is against anonymity, where people can say anything without a name tied to them, so they face no retribution. 

Wow, yeah, so now after reading the chapter again, I understand the author seems to be right-leaning. **He is scared that the Internet doesn't have enough people of power who can just turn the noise down with their authoritarian remarks**. Reminds me of what I was reading about technocracy and technopopulism. 

So, yeah, I wonder if Byung is a Nazi, right-wing, authoritarian philosopher. I hope not!!

**Outrage society

OUTRAGE SOCIETY

**Waves of outrage mobilize and bundle attention very efficiently. However, their fluidity and volatility make them unsuited to shaping public discourse or public space.** They are too uncontrollable, incalculable, inconstant, ephemeral, and amorphous for that. They well up abruptly-and they dissipate just as soon. **They are like smart mobs. They lack the stability, constancy, and continuity that are indispensable for civil exchange**. Accordingly, they defy integration into a stable discursive context. **Waves of outrage often occur in response to events of only meager social or political relevance**.

**Outrage society is scandal society. It lacks bearing reserve and posture**. The fractiousness, hysteria, and intractability that characterize waves of outrage do not admit tactful or matter-of-fact communication; they bar dialogue and discourse. Yet bearing, a measured stance, is what constitutes the civil sphere. **By the same token, distance is necessary for this sphere to emerge.** More still, waves of outrage evince little identification with the community as it stands. T**he outraged do not form a stable we who are displaying concern for society as a whole. Enraged citizens, even though they are citizens, do not demonstrate concern for the whole of the social body so much as for themselves. For this reason, outrage quickly dissipates.**

**The first word of The Iliad is menin which means "rage" or "wrath."** "Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles." So begins the first act of narration in Western culture. **Here, rage can be sung because it carries the story of the poem as a whole: it structures, inspires, animates, and gives rhythm.** Simply put, it is the heroic medium of action. **The Iliad is a song of rage**. **This rage is narrative-epic because it tells of certain actions.** On this score, rage is fundamentally different from anger, the affect of waves of outrage. **Digital outrage cannot be sung. It admits neither action nor narration. Instead, it is an affective condition, devoid of the power to act.** The general distraction and dissipation characterizing society today prevent the epic energy of rage from arising. **Rage, in the strong sense, is more than an affective state. It means the capacity, or power, to interrupt existing conditions and bring about new ones.** **In this way, it produces the future. Today's fits of outrage are extremely fleeting and scattered. Outrage lacks the mass the gravitation that is necessary for action. It generates no future.**

OUTRAGE SOCIETY

**No respect

"Distance is what makes respectare different from spectare. A society without respect, without the pathos of distance, paves the way for the society of scandal."

"Across the board, digital communication is abolishing distance and distances."

"**Social networks wind up being exhibition rooms for highly personal matters."**

**"Names and respect are linked."**

"Anonymous letters are readily discarded."

"Today, participants in communication do not just consume information passively: they generate it actively."

"Everyone is sender and receiver - consumer and producer - in one."

"It [the shitstorm] swells in spaces where power and authority have weakened. In particular, shitstorms flourish where hierarchies have flattened out."

"The best shield against shitstorms would be charisma - that is, an auratic expression of power. Charisma prevents shitstorms from brewing up in the first place."

"The presence of power increases the likelihood that my decisions will be accepted by others. As a medium of communication, power increases the probability of yes, given the possibility of No."

"No is always loud."

"Powerful communication reduces sound and noise - that is, it reduces communicative entropy. An authoritative pronouncement eliminates burgeoning noise in one fell swoop. It generates silence, which represents room for action."

"A general decline in values is making the culture of respect crumble. Today's role models demonstrate no inner values."

Respect is constituted by ascriptions of personal and moral value. A general decline in values is making the culture of respect crumble. Today's role models demonstrate no inner values. External qualities distinguish them, above all.

**Power is a state of asymmetry.** It founds a hierarchical relationship. The communication of power does not occur dialogically. **Unlike power, respect does not necessarily imply asymmetrical conditions. Respect is often felt for role models or superiors, yet mutual respect is possible based on symmetrical recognition.** Accordingly, a ruler may even have respect for those he rules. **Today, the shitstorms that are bubbling up everywhere point to the fact that we are liv ing in a society without mutual respect.** Respect commands distance. **Both power and respect make space; they are dis tance-creating communicative media.**

Sovereignty needs to be redefined in light of shitstorms. According to **Carl Schmitt**, sovereignty is a matter of deciding when a state of exception holds. This doctrine may be translated into acoustic terms. **Sovereignty means being able to produce absolute quiet-eliminating all noise and making all others fall silent in a single stroke**. Schmitt's life did not coincide with the era of digital networks. It would surely have plunged him into a state of utter crisis. Schmitt's biography reveals a fear of waves that he experienced throughout his life. Shitstorms are also a kind of wave, which escape all control. In old age, Schmitt is said to have had the radio and television removed from his house. In light of electromagnetic waves, he even found it necessary to reformulate his famous thesis on sovereignty. Following the digital revolution, we need to reformulate Schmitt's words on sovereignty yet again: **Sovereign is he who commands the shitstorms of the Net.** 

[[content/content/Marshall McLuhan]]: "The electric technology is within the gates, and we are numb, deaf, blind, and mute about its encounter with the Gutenberg technology." 

Matters stand much the same today with regard to digital media. This new medium is reprogramming us, yet we fail to grasp the radical paradigm shift that is underway. We are hobbling along after the very medium that, below our threshold of conscious decision, is definitively changing the ways that we act, perceive, feel, think, and live together.
