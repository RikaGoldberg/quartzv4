#summary 
Ecological interdependence is necessary for understanding nature's principles of self-organization. Communities in nature have evolved over billions of years through feedback loops of recycling molecules, working together in partnership, deep interconnections so diversity becomes a strategic asset, and flexibility to create resilience during stress.

The more [[content/content/diversity|diverse]] a system is the more complex it is, the more interconnections, and a more sustained web of relationships. Fragmentation and silos in a community result in diversity being a source of friction.
