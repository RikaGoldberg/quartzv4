**About Noun22**

Noun22 is a very active contributor to the Nouns protocol. He is not a community manager but he leads community and onboarding calls and was an early member of the community. 

**Tell me about Nouns**
    
-   Nouns is a DAO and a NFT project
    
-   Nouns protocol programmatically auctions off a NFT with signature classes like noddles. Proceeds go to the treasury. 1 Noun = 1 vote regardless of purchase price.
    
-   Treasury is used to “proliferate the meme” to make Nouns very iconic.
    
-   Noun 1 was sold for $2M. 
    
-   Nouns is ~460 days old
    
-   Little Nouns makes buying a noun more accessible
    

**What has been your experience with the community at Nouns? Lessons learned?**

-   20 people when I first joined. Very tight-knit community with lofty goals but no idea where it would take us. 
    
-   A community of 15 people vs 50 is very different. The DAO feels different and reading the room is different. 
    
-   Nouns art is licensed under Creative Commons 0, which means the art can be used and re-used by anyone freely. This has enabled people to create derivative projects of nouns: stores, tv shows, etc.
    
-   Nouns means many different things to many different people. 
    
-   Nouns 22 leads onboarding calls with every new member. He also organizes a weekly call to review proposals. 
    
-   Has seen the emergence of working groups. 
    

-   Proposals for large sums of money (e.g, > 5ETH) require everyone’s attention
    
-   Nouns 22 leads small grant groups (< 5 ETH) that doesn’t require everyone’s attention to pass proposals
    
-   Nouns Pods include: technical grants, e-sports, prop house (public infrastructure)
    

-   Subject matter experts emerge to get things done effectively
    

**In your experience, what do tight-knit communities have in common?**

-   Active & engaged members who are united around a common purpose and mission.
    
-   A healthy community needs diversity of thought. People can disagree about how to implement the mission (healthy debate) but they need to be onboard with the mission.
    
-   A feeling that “if I stick around and put in effort aka skin in the game, I will be rewarded. Or perhaps a feeling that “I’m working on something bigger than myself.” 
    
-   Long-term incentives to get people through the inevitable hard times.
    

**What do weak communities have in common?**

-   In many weak crypto communities, people flood into a Discord in hopes of making a bunch of money. The token pumps, then dumps, and there is nothing holding people together to stick around.
    
-   A weak community has a lack of purpose and shared goals. 
    
-   Weak communities don’t have a shared purpose and long-term incentive to get people through the hard times.
    
-   As humans, we want to attain wealth and status, so there’s nothing wrong with communities that help you achieve that, but there have to be long-term incentives and a common mission and purpose to get people through hard times. 
    

**How do Nouns manage tension/conflict?**

-   Unlike Defi protocols that have clear winners and losers, Nouns disagreements and conflicts are low stakes. We’re just creating art and brand. 
    

**How do people who buy Nouns get access to governance?** 

-   The Noun that you bought gives you access to vote on proposals. 
    
-   ~460ish Nouns. About 40-50 people who are very engaged and participate in governance. People in DAOs don’t understand that governance is not fun. It’s not leisure. There is responsibility. They’re protecting investments and making other people money. 
    
-   Delegation has emerged. Nouns 22 is a delegator for many people. 
    
**What does treasury get used for?** 

-   Anything to proliferate the meme. 
    
-   E.g. budlight was given a free noun to use in a commercial
    
-   Made real life sunglasses
    
-   Pods are funded with budgets**
