- Genuine friendship, connection, meaning. We all want and need that. It's best to have it in real life. Online communities should supplement that, not replace it. Online communities are good for exchanging ideas and pondering on deep thoughts, exchanging some messages, but the gamification by algorithms makes the whole thing super contrived. Just like dating apps. Dating becomes a game. It should not be. Friendship should also not be a game. 

- Online communities try to recreate the real world. This is dangerous because online lacks depth. People are very one-dimensional.
