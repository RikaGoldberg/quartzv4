This is a scaffold of my intellectual pursuits. I acknowledge that it will change over time, as it should, but this is a good starting point to find signal in the noise. 

Information is different from knowledge, and my goal is to obtain knowledge, so I can become a public intellectual. 

Why do I want to be a public intellectual? 

- I believe it is suited for my personality and the person I want to be. I love my brain. I am fascinated by it. Since I was a kid, I was fascinated by the mind and the brain. 
	- Up until now, my [[content/content/brain]] has emerged on its own. I have fed it information, some good, some bad, but it hasn't been focused. 
	- Yes, in a way, I am obsessed with molding human thought, my own thought specifically. I want to experiment on myself. 
- I believe it's fun. It satisfied my itch to be social, to have a diverse group of friends, whom I admire, who are working on great things. 
- Twitter is the place in modern times for public intellectuals, to meet, discuss.

The problem is that there is too much information tossed at us on the Internet. Knowledge is hard to come by. There is too much noise. 

**Things I want to write about: 
- De-credentialism
	- Is this a recent phenomena or have philosophers & public intellectuals always kind of been without academic credentials? 
		- I remember reading that Plato/Aristotle didn't have proper schooling??**ato/Aristotle didn't have proper schooling??

Finally, [[content/content/Marshall McLuhan]] described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth century", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and perspective by typography, while "the technique of the suspended judgment is the discovery of the twentieth century," brought on by the bard abilities of radio, movies and television.
	The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear-view mirror. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land.
