@Stew - machine humming, 1 post/week

@Rika Goldberg  - Guidepost for governance, know who's doing what, and what work is valued, etc. (Not specific to the publication)

@jlevers - Clear path as to what we are trying to do over the course of the following year. Knowing where we're going enough to look a bit further in the future than we have been.

@Rob Hardy - I want to see us actually function as a DAO. Get some loose early governance structure in place. Let's vote on stuff that's meaningful to Foster. Doing stuff in the real world, that mostly means the publication at this point -- how do we do this fluidly and working collaboratively on it. New people in here, onboarding, offboarding. Having some process to have new voices coming in. If we can make it 3mo.6mo on a publication and still be proud of it that's like the ultimate thing. How can we all actually be proud of this?

@Theresa Sam Houghton  - Echo the sentiment of structure, especially for the publication. Have something that works like a smoothly running engine, without being a standard internet content machine, unique and interesting but also really soothly on the
