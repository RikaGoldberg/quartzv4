DAO tooling is working to create circles and nested layers in organization structure vs hierarchies. We see networks in nature. 

Great visuals to include:

- 5.18 nature networks
- 15.21 Collective belief manifests into reality 
- 
Sub DAOs can belong to many DAOs, so there's nesting going on.

Nested layers vs. monolithic structure. Less hierarchical. 

Objective value is a composition of everyone's subjective value on chain (primitives)

DAOs are measuring value in non-monetary ways like coordinape, sourcecred

Get a map of what's valuable and distribute money based on the map. Money is a means, not the end.
