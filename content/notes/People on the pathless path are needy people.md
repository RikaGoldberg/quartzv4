Today, my friend Astrid Wilde, who I met 
through the Internet (Twitter), kind of like a long lost kindred soul, told me she has been loving getting an email a day from me.

Writing every day, being vulnerable, sharing events from my personal life, is meaningful, but challenging. 

Excerpt from Paul Millerd's book, The Pathless Path: 

According to Agnes Callard, people on aspirational journeys, or what I call the pathless path, are “characteristically needy people.” Because their worldviews are incomplete and evolving, **they are dependent on the support of other people.**

I remember when I was first started out writing online, it's the blogs I read, the digital gardens I came across, that inspired me and showed me that I can do this too. I usually didn't interact with the authors because I was just not in the mindset, I was a consumer, and I thought "who was I to reach out to this person" and "what would I say..." this is why most people who use Twitter are passive consumers. I think there's a lot of value in interacting, commenting. 

This is Web2 ---> an Internet that gave us youtube with comments, an ability to interact, and not just static content.
