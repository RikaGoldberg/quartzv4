I write in [ETHPorto Targets/Goals](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/ethporto-targets-goals/1106)

> I plan to uncover and discover interesting and useful information during this conference that I can then turn into knowledge and action items to get us to our $3M fundraising goal. LFG!

I write in [ETHPorto Conference](/notes/ETHPorto%20Conference.md)

> My goals for ETHPorto were to 1) meet new and different types of people; 2) learn about the European Web3 landscape and how people think about crypto and DAOs; and 3) fundraise/find patrons. 

From the talks, several themes emerged. I took photos of these slides (see images below). In summary, the themes are: 

- Public Goods (an obvious one as it is a core pillar of Ethereum). 
	- This theme is timeless. I have written quite a bit about it and I want to write more on it. I know MetaGame has written some pieces on this topic as well. Could also be an interesting collaboration opportunity with DAO Research Collective (after the Decentralization QC!)
- Impact DAOs (projects that create positive externalities)
	-E.g. Gitcoin, Toucan, Blockscience, Proof of Humanity, Kernel, Vita DAO, Ocean Protocol, ReFi DAO, Regen Network
- Bridging the gap between Web2 & Web3:
	- Decentralized Science
		- E.g. Athena DAO, Agora Labs, Love DAO, Vibe DAO, The Innovation Game, Cherubs DAO 
	- Gnosis Chain, bridging the gap to the real world (talk title)
		- I'd like to watch the livestream once available. Presenter was Stefan George from Gnosis
		
Other interesting topics:
* Hackathon projects will be granted funds by conference attendees with quadratic funding 
* ENS multi-chain

I also gave a talk on [Gamification in Web3](/notes/EthPorto%20Talk%20-%20Gamification%20in%20Web3.md) specifically about game design i.e, good gamification vs. bad gamification. I want to continue building on this talk (writing about it and presenting it at conferences) since MetaGame is an online coordination game. What exactly that means is interesting and necessary to write about and get feedback on. 

The conference went as well as it could have. I made new contacts, surveyed the Ethereum landscape in Europe, and several people approached me after my talk to learn more about MetaGame. The next steps of following up with new contacts and taking action to get new players and patrons will be critical for MetaGame to reach its goal of raising $3M.  In addition, researching and thinking through legal entity structures is important for fundraising efforts.
