[A platform is composable if its existing resources can be used as building blocks and programmed into higher order applications. Composability is important because it allows developers to do more with less, which in turn, can lead to more rapid and compounding innovation.](https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability/?curius=1259)

[This capability of composability is one of the most talked-about [among](https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/4-eras-of-blockchain-computing-degrees-of-composability/) tech enthusiasts, and not talked about enough more broadly, yet it’s one of the most powerful aspects of crypto. Because composability allows anyone in a network to take existing programs and adapt or build on top of them, it unlocks completely new use cases that don’t exist in our world](https://future.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else?curius=1259,1528,1300)
