## Highlights from Jenny Odell's book *How to Do Nothing*

> Things may seem bad now, but some would argue that the la 1960s were worse. Nixon was president, the Vietnam War war raging, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, and unarmed student protestors were shot at Kent State destroy Signs of environmental devastation were accumulating, and large scale urban redevelopment projects and freeways were ing the fabric of "blighted" ethnic neighborhoods. All the while successful adulthood was pictured as a two-car garage house in a white suburb. To young people, this looked like a sham, and they were ready to quit.
   >**Between 1965 and 1970, more than a thousand communal groups formed across the country. The writer Robert Houriet, who visited fifty American "communal experiments" between 1968 and 1970. described this movement as "the gut reaction of a generation" who saw no other way to resist:**

> To a country seemingly entrenched in self-interest, deaf to change and blind to its own danger, **they said "Fuck it" and split.** If the cities were uninhabitable and the suburbs plastic, they would still have to live somewhere. If the spirit of humane community and culture were dead in urban Amerika, they would have to create their own.
  >	Those who fled to the communes took a particularly ahistorical view of time; according to Houriet, the communes were relatively unaware of the history of utopian experiments-maybe even Epicurus's garden school. But this is perhaps to be expected from anyone desperately seeking a complete break from everything. **Houriet writes that those who fled "had no time to assess the historical parallels or to make careful plans for the future... Their flight was desperate."** After all, this wasn't the 1960s; it was the Age of Aquarius, an exit from time and a chance to start from scratch:
	> Somewhere in the line of history, civilization had made a wrong turn, a detour that had led into a cul-de-sac. The only way, they felt, was to drop out and go all the way back to the beginning, to the primal source of consciousness, the true basis of culture: the land.
	>In his description of the Drop City commune in a book by the same name, Drop City resident Peter Rabbit describes the general outline: "put together some bread, buy a piece of land, make the land free, **and start rebuilding the economic, social, and spiritual structures of man from the bottom up." He adds, however, that "none of these people had any idea that that's what they were doing... We just thought we were dropping out."**

> **Probably the biggest problem that the communes faced, though, was the idea of starting from scratch**. In many ways, "going back to the beginning" meant **rehashing timeworn struggles over governance and the rights of the individual**, albeit in capsule form. There was, after all, a potential paradox at the heart of the whole endeavor. **Retreat and refusal are the precise moments in which the individual distinguishes herself from the mob, declining to buy a house and a car and conform to a stodgy, oppressive society where, as Diamond puts it, "there was always some Total Death Corporation job with your name on it."** But in order for these refuseniks to stay out and function as a commune, they needed to negotiate balance between the individual and the group. As Weiss recalled of the Philadelphia commune, "**the slipperiest decisions always involved reconciling privacy and communality, the individual and house in other words, the very fundamentals of governance.**
	> Politics inevitably surfaced, sometimes like an unwelcome guest a house party. At Bryn Athyn, a short-lived commune near Stratford Vermont, Houriet describes the general apathy of the members when one of them tries to figure out the legal details of buying the farm. And when conflicts arose, a political process was notably lacking.




## Notes
Are DAOs as idealistic as communes? Are DAOs disgruntled employees, battered by the system, who are refusing by creating something new from scratch..from the bottom up...

The difference is that DAOs aren't reinventing the wheel. They are leveraging existing governance structures. Principles from democracy...

Decentralized cities and countries are too mechanistic, like Walden II. Technocratic regimes are not good. 

The privatization of everything is also not good.
