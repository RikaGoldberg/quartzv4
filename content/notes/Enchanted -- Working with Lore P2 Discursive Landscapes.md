### Highlights

This gets a key characteristic of [lore](/notes/Lore.md). Lore helps enable communication about the meaning making that provides the basis for judgment. Lore establishes patterns that aid people in ascribing significance to data and articulating that significance to others, often in contexts where memory and experience are key. Making the right judgment can be challenging, especially when there's a lot at stake. This is one reason why organizations develop. Organizations help people navigate information problems and provide frameworks to facilitate the passage of judgment. Organizations also help to distribute the risk involved in decision making. 3

This is the paradox of information technology. Access to information does not necessarily make it meaningful. Shared context, histories, patterns, and systems of symbols are required to provide a meaningful context that enables information to be transformed into knowledge. But these things are fragile, contextual, and often opaque. The transparency of information technology writes Haridimos Tsoukas is "illusory." 1

Information in public becomes contentious and is subject to conflicting sets of assumptions and contextualization. In contrast, expert systems utilize shared experience, context, and intent to frame information in a way that is meaningful.

Often the ability to detect patterns is associated with expertise. For many areas of expertise, there is no substitute for gaining embodied experience which serves as the foundation for correctly ascribing meaning to information.

People in organizations need to be able to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, and make judgments about the risks involved that are informed by the knowledge they posses. In many organizations, this takes on a specific form.

This corresponds closely to Christopher Alexander's idea of pattern languages. 5 When building a cathedral, Alexander says that the structure is first built in language. The conversations of the masons and carpenters, speaking in common patterns, approach key judgments and apply these insights to the specific contexts on the challenges they face. In this way, the structure emerges out of the language of all involved.

There were hundreds of people, each making his part within the whole, working, often for generations. At any given moment there was usually one master builder, who directed the overall layout... but each person in the whole had, in his mind, the same overall language. Each person executed each detail in the same general way, but but with minor differences. The master builders did not need to force design of the details down the builders' throats, because the builders themselves knew enough of the shared pattern language to make the details correctly, with their own individual flair. 5

Working semi-autonomously, holding a shared set of patterns enabled the builders to "run" the project in their head, acting in conjunction with the others involved in the project and approach the problem space with the same intention. When this happens the shared goals are emergent within the patterns of activity themselves.

Alexander, adds one more quality to the language of people building together. He stresses the importance of that language being grounded in a life beyond the professional world. "First to be living as a language, it must be the shared vision of a group of people, very specific to their culture, able to capture their hopes and dreams, containing many childhood memories, and special local ways of doing things, " 5 Alexander makes a special point to identify the fact that this language is rooted in a constellation of peopleâ€”that it emerges from community.

Lore enables communication about meaning making, providing basis for judgment, while also supplying structures and strategies to determine how and in what manner to put these judgments to work. Lore also give people insight into how their work connects to the work of others and situates this within a network of people, culture and cosmology.

Stepping into web3 lore presents two significant challenges. 1. horizontal organizations have specific coordination problems to solve which requires putting lore to work in specific ways. 2. Default to writing indicates a fundamental shift has taken place. The domain of lore has migrated from the spoken language to the written language.

The first step in understanding how teams use lore is to build a shared understanding of the word.

An expert system cannot be made fully transparent for all to see its workings; there is no detached Olympian high ground from which it may be inspected. Transparency inevitably presupposes a subject: transparent to whom? If this question is raised, one realizes that what the outsiders see (and the significance they attach to what they see) is not the same as what the insiders see (and the significance they attach to their experiences).

In Narrative Construction as Sensemaking: How a Central Bank Thinks, Mitchel Abolafia stresses that judgment is arrived at through the collective process of narrative craft:

This points to the next feature of lore. It enables communication about meaning making, providing basis for judgment, while also supplying structures and strategies to determine how and in what manner to put these judgments to work. Lore helps order insights and transform them into operationalizable pathways. Lore enables the application of patterns of meaning making, and patterns of activity

Roles Lore shapes roles, defining responsibilities, building mental models of the job to be done, and helping to coordinate the work of autonomous contributors. Lore can enable people to run the role virtually in their head, or take on another role when needed based on the patterns and narratives they have absorbed. Lore also plays a role helping people to understand the responsibilities and expectations of their position, making them more reliable within the context of the organization. Moreover, lore enables people to speak within a history of practitioners. Often this element becomes invisible, but the lore is manifest in the specific vocabulary of a domain, and sometimes emerges when justification is required, citing stories, experience, principals or thinkers which have shaped their practice.
