I. I was listening to a podcast with Ryan Holiday the other day and a few ideas stood out
	A. He always knows what he is going to write next to avoid the [[content/content/existential dread]] of finishing a project and not knowing what you will write next
	B. There's always more things to do. Finishing a project just means there is another one, so enjoy the process, and learn as much as you can from it.
	C. When you become more of a public figure, and a better writer, people want you to work on stuff and they want to pay you a lot of money, very enticing, but that means you're trading off something else. Every yes is a no to something else. 
	D. Every day, just make progress on a chapter or on a section. Find the ones that you do know how to write about. 
II. I have learned, through experience, the importance of just good enough [[content/content/Embrace good enough structures and processes|just good enough]]
	III. I used to hate outlining, but with this good enough approach it ain't bad because it's useful
IV. When writing a book, you can write about an infinite number of things. There are an infinite number of directions you can take your ideas in. 
	A. Lincoln told me this when we played music together, that for as many people as there are, there are equally as many ways to create a song.
	B. Infinity is so important, as it is an analogy for self-organizing systems
		[[content/content/self-organized systems must be diverse]]
V. I feel edgy today after working all day intensely yesterday. 
	A. Although I feel energized, I also feel edgy, like my capacity has come to an end. 
	B. Reminds me of the past me when I used to work a lot, on my computer in the evening too. But this means I am making tradeoffs, like I'm not spending time with family, or engaging in a hobby, or learning a new skill, or going to a social event, or just relaxing. 
VI. It's important to have some guideposts to know where you're aiming.
