Projects with bad tokenomics have (1) inflationary supply and (2) no utility i.e, demand. Staking creates new incentives for demand. Projects come up with new products for their token e.g, rJOE, sJOE, veJOE (Trader Joe in 2022) to increase demand by varying incentives. When you unstake your tokens, you lose them.

#fleetingnotes These rules are very punishment driven. It seems like this past year, protocols have come up with less punishable ways to incentivize behavior. E.g on the governance side, you don't lose your delegated tokens if you decide to sell. The smart contract automatically un-delegates them and adjusts the voting power of delegate.  Why do we even need individuals to delegate votes? Yes, it's fun to experiment but individuals should make money from their tokens (oops, this is speculation and a security if you're using a token to make profit from it.)

Stablecoins are in a war for liquidity, so they sometimes bribe you to vote for them. You can vote on [Curve Finance](/notes/Curve%20Finance.md) for which AMM pools get the most rewards. With more voting power, you can vote for your pool.

VeTokens are called “liquid lockers” **because holders lock up their tokens in exchange for special rights.** This prevents speculative selling like what happened with UNI and COMP, **pioneers in Defi token design, because there was no underlying demand other than speculative selling.**

A common pattern we saw in DeFi token design for projects that launched before mid-to-late 2021 was the **“valueless governance token” model.**
  
**With this model, token holders are solely entitled to governance rights.** While this may have been a way to avert regulatory scrutiny, and governance is certainly an incredibly valuable right, **this meant that holders have no claim on cash flows,** **and the token provides no utility or perks to any stakeholders within the protocol**; meaning that aside from speculation, **there is no underlying demand for the token.**

**One such model has been the “ve (vote-escrowed) model. Pioneered by Michael Egorov of Curve Finance, the ve-model involves token-holders taking on the risk of locking their tokens in exchange for specific rights, such as governance power, within a protocol.**

**Fueled in large part by the “Curve Wars” and despite being a “DeFi 1.0” coin, the price of CRV, and its largest holder, CVX, bucked the broader sector trend and outperformed in Q3 and Q4 2021, returning 265.4% and 1085.7% respectively, relative to a 12.2% gain for DPI.**

A primary benefit of the ve-model is that it incentivizes long-term-oriented decision-making. This is because by locking their tokens for a certain period of time (typically 1 - 4 years), a holder is making a long-term commitment to the protocol.

A second way in which the ve-model has proven to be beneficial is that it can align incentives across a wide swath of protocol participants and stakeholders.

A final reason as to why the ve-model is powerful is through improving the supply and demand dynamics of a project’s token, i.e. helping number go up.

**Although holders are giving up liquidity, they are being compensated for this risk by being awarded special privileges within the protocol, as veCRV holders are entitled to a share of the fees generated from swaps made on Curve, boosted CRV emissions when providing liquidity, and as previously mentioned, governance rights.**

**As previously discussed, the first iteration of DeFi tokens, the “valuelesss governance token” model, creates perpetual sell pressure with no underlying demand to help stem the downward tide.**

**For supply, vote-locking serves as a mechanism to remove tokens from the open market. This helps to offset the high emissions that some protocol’s produce, and we’ve seen existing ve-tokens be locked at very high rates.**
