As I write in my Champion proposal 

It's important to differentiate between what is active now and what will be active in the future. 

V1. Where is V1 today? Is it being kept hidden and secret somewhere. No, of course not. This dialogue is between V1 and V2. Where will V3 be? 

MetaGame ComposeDB profiles today. Are they being used by people in V1 or in V2? What is our plan with them? To make it more DAO wide.
