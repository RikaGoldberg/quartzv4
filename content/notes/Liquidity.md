[New research published today shows that Uniswap Protocol v3 has deeper liquidity in ETH/USD, ETH/BTC and other ETH pairs than leading centralized exchanges. This research demonstrates that AMM market structure – which is largely crypto-native today – can surpass order-book exchanges and transform traditional financial market structure to be more liquid, stable, and secure](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/05/the-dominance-of-uniswap-v3-liquidity?curius=1873)

Uniswap v3 also has higher market depth across all price levels, which means it’s even more advantageous for users to execute larger trades on Uniswap v3 relative to centralized exchanges. For an ETH/dollar trade size of $5mm, for example, the savings would be around $24,000 given the expected price impact difference.

Traditional market structure is dominated by a few market makers. But easy liquidity creation (AMMs) dramatically lowers the barrier to create and participate in markets. This unlocks new and existing forms of value for communities and individuals.
