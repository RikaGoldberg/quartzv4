## The Ayn Rand Reader, Ayn Rand, Gary Hull (Editor), Leonard Peikoff

### Update Sept. 30 2022
Even though I do not agree with Ayn Rand's beliefs, she can help me to think. The ability to weigh different perspectives and value systems and come up with a position is something Greek tragedy can teach us. Martha Nussbaum writes about it in her book [The Fragility of Goodness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250887.The_Fragility_of_Goodness)

**I asked my Twitter friends which female authors impacted them the most and Haider & Yalor both said Ayn Rand.**

So I picked up the [Ayn Rand Reader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37682.Ayn_Rand_Reader) to understand her philosophy for myself. 

My friend Davin is really salty about Ayn Rand. He says it's a book for people who have read a total of 5 books in their life. And people use it as an excuse to not have empathy.

**Ayn Rand is against altruism. She calls the suffering parasites, and the altruists as perpetrators of the suffering cycle. 

Ayn also denies intergenerational trauma and is anti affirmative action. She makes the case for reverse discrimination i.e, affirmative action discriminates against whites. 

I think this is ludicrous. Not once does she talk about how diversity is extremely important to a flourishing society.

I'm wondering now, does it really matter that Ayn Rand is against altruism and compassion? Our beliefs change. I think it's a problem only if people to this day read Ayn Rand and buy into her belief system. There's a lot more research though these days about the science of emotions. Even the science of being stuck. The softer science, the psychology is so important. 

Reminds me of the Zen saying, "in 100 years, all new people." Screw Ayn Rand. She's not worth my time. Focus on better. 

[Donella Meadows](/notes/Donella%20Meadows.md) advocates for diversity in systems, borrowing from nature, and [Noah Smith](/notes/Noah%20Smith.md) also advocates for diversity.
