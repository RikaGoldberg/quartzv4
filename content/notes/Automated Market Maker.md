Automated market makers (AMMs) are a type of [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex) that use algorithmic “money robots” to make it easy for individual traders to buy and sell crypto assets. Instead of trading directly with other people as with a traditional order book, users trade directly through the AMM. 

Market makers are entities tasked with providing liquidity for a tradable asset on an exchange that may otherwise be illiquid. Market makers do this by buying and selling assets from their own accounts with the goal of making a profit, often from the spread—the gap between the highest buy offer and lowest sell offer. Their trading activity creates liquidity, lowering the price impact of larger trades.

While other types of decentralized exchange (DEX) designs exist, AMM-based DEXs have become extremely popular, providing deep liquidity for a wide range of digital tokens.
