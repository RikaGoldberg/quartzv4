#quotes 
It’s not every day an artist comes along with a story as interesting as TwistedVacancy’s. A young artist out of Jakarta, Indonesia, Twisted has been mastering his artistic craft for the last 4 years. Artworks combining complex and thoughtful subject matters with incredible illustration and color theory, we had a feeling Twisted would find huge success on SuperRare.
Since joining the SR artist family a few months ago, TwistedVacancy has tokenized 12 single-edition artworks. So far 11 of them have sold to collectors for an average price of more than 4.5 ETH (around $765), with 5 of them selling for more than $1,000 USD (see below). **By focusing on scarcity**, Twisted has succeeded in maintaining the highest average sale price of any artist with more than one artwork sold. Best part? He’s incredibly humble about his early success.

**_Q: What has been your all-time favorite moment since joining SuperRare?_**

A: I remember the day I joined SuperRare [Trevor Jones](https://superrare.co/trevorjonesart) tokenized his first piece in collaboration with [Alotta_Money](https://superrare.co/alotta_money) and sold it for over $10,000. I was here to see his historical moment and it was an important day for me. I’ll never forget that moment and all the excitement I had watching that unfold. Really encouraging for me.
