The large brain size in human beings was socially and sexually selected based on our ability and propensity to participate in the process of discovering and facilitating non-zero-sum games (which is equivalent to the process of complexification).

complexification

Ever since human beings evolved the ability to talk we have been telling stories about people who were best able to participate in this process. Over time, the general pattern underlying these stories was abstracted out and encoded into the hero mythologies found cross-culturally. 

physicist Lee Smolin

This means that the picture of the universe in which life, variety and structure are improbable accidents must be an outmoded relic of nineteenth-century science. Twentieth-century physics must lead instead towards the understanding that the universe is hospitable to life because, if the world is to exist at all, then it must be full of structure and variety. (p. 16)

He also reasoned that systems in nature must self-organize to this narrow window from the bottom-up, through the interactions of the parts of the system in relation to their environment

As cosmic evolution proceeds, the world is becoming increasingly organized, increasingly functional, and, because life and consciousness emerge from sufficient complexity and information integration, increasingly sentient. (p. 5)

Complexity requires both order and chaos

Once the mixture is completely stirred, however, there is now a state of perfect disorder (i.e., perfect entropy) and there is no longer any complexity.

We will need to know more in order to understand the emergence of hierarchical complexity, i.e., the fact that different patterns emerge at different levels of analysis (e.g., the atomic, molecular, organic, etc.) 

These competing interactions can be as simple as the competition between short- and long-range interactions in a molecular structure or as complex as the competing interaction between the interests of an individual and the interests of the group he is embedded in.

Both Stewart and Wright claim that biological and cultural evolution have a direction and that direction is towards the increasing scope of non-zero-sum games or cooperation

Rather, the scale of cooperation increases when groups find ways to put the selfish interests of individuals in alignment with the interests of the group. This can involve, for example, conferring status benefits onto people who display group beneficial behavior and/or punishing people who display behaviors that harm the group.

Leaders, then, are chosen based on their pro-social temperament and their intelligence.

Finding solutions to problems that satisfy the competing interests of these different groups is combinatorially explosive and evolutionarily important. 

Our ability to realize relevance is largely determined by our ability to properly formulate problems and to re-formulate them when necessary. This is the role of insight. We formulate problems by framing them in particular ways. This frame constrains the kind of solutions that seem viable to us. When we have an insight we break our current frame and adopt a new frame. The new frame allows us to reformulate the problem in such a way that better solutions become viable to us

Those who are best able to engage in the process of relevance realization will also be those who are best able to discover and facilitate non-zero-sum games among their group (i.e., joint utility improvement), as discussed in section 3. 

We use stories to regulate our emotions and govern our behavior; use stories to provide the present we inhabit with a determinate point of reference – the desired future.

The optimal “desired future” is not a state, however, but a process – the (intrinsically compelling) process of mediating between order and chaos;

The hero is narrative representation of the individual eternally willing to take creative action, endlessly capable of originating new behavioral patterns, eternally specialized to render harmless or positively beneficial something previously threatening or unknown.

The peculiar properties of critical systems enlightened in thermodynamics and statistical physics are at the roots of a conjecture stating that systems at the phase transition achieve the highest level of computational capability.

ordered regimes are too rigid to be able to compute complex tasks, as changes are rapidly erased and the flow of information among the units of the system is rather low

disordered regimes are too erratic to provide a reliable response to inputs, as perturbations and noise spread unboundedly, preventing effective information transmission and storage

What does it mean for an agent to “disrupt their own fixed-point attractors”?

Much of psychopathology consists of people getting stuck in ruts (i.e., fixed patterns of behavior) of one kind or another. This can refer to addictions, bad relationships, or a variety of bad habits.

Changing one’s way of life is always accompanied by uncertainty and anxiety. It is all-too-often the avoidance of this anxiety that causes people to get stuck in these various ruts.

The way forward requires the voluntary acceptance, and therefore transcendence, of the suffering that accompanies necessary changes. This voluntary acceptance of suffering is the implicit ideal represented by the mythological hero figure (e.g., Marduk’s voluntary confrontation of the dragon Tiamat, Horus’ voluntary descent into the underworld, the Buddha’s voluntary journey towards enlightenment, and Jesus Christ’s voluntary acceptance of crucifixion).

One of the most common sources of psychopathology is the refusal to pay attention to one’s own accumulating errors. It hurts to recognize that we have made a mistake. It means that we must let go of the part of ourselves that caused us to make that mistake. I have often witnessed people go to great lengths to avoid the pain of admitting to themselves that they made a mistake. This refusal to pay attention to errors can, of course, allow us to avoid suffering in the short term. But in the long term it only allows the problem to grow into something much worse. 

This is simply another way of saying that we must pay attention to our own errors (and equally our successes) so that we can adjust our behavior accordingly.

Paying attention to errors, and adjusting ourselves in response to them, is painful.

The more one engages with nonzero-sum activities the more opportunities for development emerge—new skills to hone, new qualities to develop, new people to engage and collaborate with. The pursuit of nonzero-sum activities is therefore likely to be conducive to maintaining metastable attunement, and therefore to living a flourishing life

In the Newtonian-reductionist worldview, human beings are insignificant players in an indifferent universe. We are small, short-lived specks of dust in comparison to the massive size and time-scale of the universe at large. But the new science of complexity has made clear that the Newtonian worldview has inappropriately privileged space and time. Why should size or longevity determine how important something is?

This means that what we do actually matters in the grand scheme of things.
