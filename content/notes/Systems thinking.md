[Donella Meadows 1](quartz/content/notes/Donella%20Meadows%201.md) was a proponent of designing systems that are harmonious with nature. 

Working at MIT in the early 1970s, Donnella brought a fresh perspective to a field dominated by computer models that attempted to predict the future. 

She warned about the consequences of over relying on these models and challenged her colleagues to think about systems more holistically, focusing on relationships and value flow.
