## How do you change systems?
The great systems thinker [Donella Meadows](/notes/Donella%20Meadows.md) says this in her book [Thinking in Systems](notes/Thinking%20in%20Systems.md)

>So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science, has a lot to say about that. You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm. You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one. You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You donâ€™t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.

DAOs are changing how people coordinate and work with one another. 

To achieve system change, you need to change [relationships](/notes/Relationships.md) between the elements of the system.
