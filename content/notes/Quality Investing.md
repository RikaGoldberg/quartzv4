TL;DR Quality Investing as a strategy is the Warren Buffett approach, the traditional investing approach, where you invest with a long-term timeframe. You invest consistently, in stocks that you know about, that people are talking about, that have a good reputation, that have already won, the best in the industry, thus making them safe bets. 

Quality investing strategy can be applied to both traditional equities and cryptocurrency. Big names like Ethereum and Bitcoin would be quality buys. There are probably more quality buys too, such as Solana, Polkadot, etc. Right?
