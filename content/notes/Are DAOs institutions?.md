Based on the definition of institution as a set of individuals within a community who set rules, then, yeah, DAOs are institutions because they set rules for self-organization, for coordination, for voting and governance.

I think so. If I read the definition, again, of institution, DAOs create rules that govern the behaviors of community members. Or do they? Where are MetaFactory's rules? Maybe in their Discord channel? And also in DAOHaus?
