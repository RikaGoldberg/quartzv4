## Assume you don't know
Maybe you have experience running an Internet business or an online community. 

Maybe you worked outside of business and tech. 

Regardless of your prior industry and role, you found your way to DAOs because you are dissatisfied with the status quo. Current organizational structures no longer float your boat. You desire to make an impact and create change. 

This desire can make you feel like we already know your wei around a DAO and you can make the mistake of acting too soon.

My advice is: just don’t do it. In the metaverse, just like in the real world, the desire to act too quickly will get you into trouble.

Let me demonstrate with a thought experiment.

Imagine this. 

You start a new job and, within the first week, you schedule a meeting with the CEO to tell her all the things that you would like to change and how you will go about changing them. 

You say something like:

“Heeey, I really think we should write a whitepaper and update the marketing plan and dust the cobwebs off of our Github documentation. What would you like me to get started on first?”

You may hear a response that sounds something like the one the Russian navy ship heard when, in March 2022, it asked Ukrainian soldiers to surrender:

 [go f*** yourself.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Russian+warship...+Go+fuck+yourself) 

On a similar token, when you enter a DAO, no matter how many DAOs you have previously contributed to, don’t act like you know your wei around, and don’t immediately offer your help. 

Instead, wait. Use the time to follow your curiosity:  reach out individually to people whom you find interesting and learn about the DAO by watching how it works. 

Your goal should be to understand the DAO’s structure: the [Relationships](/notes/Relationships.md) between people and what the incentives are for value flow.

## Allow nature to be your guide
>In any complex endeavor, you can rarely forecast ahead of time which of several shared foundations will be the optimal one: you need only something that is ‟good enough,ˮ and let emergence guide you from there.

Nature follows the system principle of [Self-Organization](/notes/Self-Organization.md). We see this principle at work in animal swarming, from how birds flock to how ants work in groups.

Let’s look at how ants organize.

![ants](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QimwG9t4EyRWlnC1y_CaQ0XxDrRbKAVOJmnyFOQyUZgOh0Rc0lrtJqwRYFr0_pfAWNLNw5cKHF42cKtT0lxHhKuzKdJUo08nn0lLS-LsqpfbQHMCI1HVvpU7jDUWBT6txRhg7q7l)

Ants organize and work together beautifully and harmoniously by reacting to stimuli in their environments, listening to their senses, and smelling their wei around. Intuition is their guide.

Mother Nature designed ant colonies to be leaderless. The queen ant, the mother of all the ants, does not provide any guidance to her babies. Instead, she allows them to follow their instincts and trust their scent, in turn creating space for the wonder of [emergence](/notes/emergence.md)

An ant colony functions like a factory where each ant specializes in a certain task, deciding what the task is based on personal preferences, interactions with other ants, and cues in the environment. 

This type of [organizational structure](/notes/Organizational%20structure.md) creates a super-organism. Ants, together, can accomplish extraordinary feats, like converting resources into more ants, hunting, and protecting the colony. These feats would be impossible for a solitary ant.

## MetaFactory Case Study
MetaFactory DAO members are like a colony of ants. Members effectively organize to become a superorganism and, together, accomplish great feats. 

MetaFactory realized that traditional monolithic organizational structures, with hierarchies and bosses that scale up horizontally, are not effective. A DAO organizational structure needs to be resilient to stress and quickly adaptable to change. 

The problem with monolithic structures is that the needle moves slowly. This hinders innovation and frustrates workers at all levels of the hierarchy. To remedy this, MetaFactory is structured in a wei that is more harmonious with nature. MetaFactory is experimenting with a [subDAOs](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1502020212136185857) structure. 

MetaFactory is building a digi-physical world. Digitally, members self-organize into working groups, small independent teams with their own objectives. [iRobot DAO](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/irobot-season-2/287) is one of these sub DAOs. Nested under MetaFactory, iRobot is its own unique DAO, focusing on  all things ROBOT (MetaFactory’s native token) like governance, liquidity, distribution, and analysis. 

Physically, goods are produced in [microfactories](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/metafactory-4-20-ted-talk/255), in-house facilities that are organized like subDAOs. [One microfactory](https://twitter.com/TheMetaFactory/status/1465825289599008769?s=20&t=UxN6tpN-5dPJE5KScBGY8Q) is already up and running in Berlin.
