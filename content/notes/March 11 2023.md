Journaling has many uses, one of which is to keep a log of your day. A diary of sorts, one can say. And yes I am using filler words, so help me god, how bad that is to be doing that. 

Some things I have hated as of late: 
- Superficial blogs that lack depth and thoughtfulness. Ugh, I kind of hate my past writing. It's cringe. People who write substacks to vent and to share emotions and feelings. 
- My thoughts are not that smart so I don't want to write anything definitive of my own. I want to prop other people up. God, I hate when I write this way. 
- I hate to read books that I understand little on topics that I am not smart in. I hate to not be smart but I also hate to be around incompetent and incapable people. 
- It's not that MetaGame people are incompetent/incapable, it's that there is little accountability to get projects completed. Like my quest chain project with dao research collective. It's taking forever. I wanted a group to work on it but it failed. People just cling to their own things. 
- I need to read more if I want to have better ideas but instead of reading, I make excuses for how the books I am reading are too hard or the internet doesn't have interesting things to read. Maybe all of these are true but I'm not diving in enough into the Internet -- the channels that I do have. 

Si, I have problems with allocating/budgeting time. 

Try starting for only 10 minutes on taxes
