Wildfire is a meta-governance initiative that creates new squads to tackle token design, governance, and coordination problems. 

It was created to help [Fire Eyes DAO](/notes/Fire%20Eyes%20DAO.md) scale.

>Not only does ðŸ”¥_ðŸ”¥ want to encourage and develop aÂ **meta-governance collective**, we also want toÂ **inspire and coordinate other, new governance squads**. Weâ€™ve seen the beginning of this from a number of groups, but we believe that in order for Ethereum and our community to successfully reshape the worldâ€™s economic and governance structures,Â **we will need many more of these squads to emerge and coordinate at scale.

We hope that the Wildfire Initiative sets a precedent for the entire Ethereum community to take learnings from our journey, see the value in the â€˜squad mentalityâ€™ and coordinate together to accelerate the development and adoption of Web3.0 at a global scale!
