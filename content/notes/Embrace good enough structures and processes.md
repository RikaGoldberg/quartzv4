Wow. This is a tall order - to just allow structures and processes to be [[content/content/Embrace good enough structures and processes|good enough]] in a world that strives for perfection. But, I want to challenge all of us, myself included, to start thinking with this new lens - a lens that embraces loose structures and flexible processes.

This means we donâ€™t strive for perfection in our work. Instead, we create a scaffolding so that our systems are just good enough, and then we experiment often and frequently to test our assumptions and update our models.
