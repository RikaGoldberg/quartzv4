### I don't like Ayn Rand
I asked my Twitter friends which female authors impacted them the most and Haider & Yalor both said Ayn Rand.

 So I picked up the [Ayn Rand Reader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37682.Ayn_Rand_Reader) to understand her philosophy for myself. 

My friend Davin is really salty about Ayn Rand. He says it's a book for people who have read a total of 5 books in their life. And people use it as an excuse to not have empathy.

Ayn Rand is against altruism. She calls the suffering parasites, and the altruists as perpetrators of the suffering cycle. 

Ayn also denies intergenerational trauma and is anti affirmative action. She makes the case for reverse discrimination i.e, affirmative action discriminates against whites. 

I think this is ludicrous. Not once does she talk about how diversity is extremely important to a flourishing society. 

[Donella Meadows](/notes/Donella%20Meadows.md) advocates for diversity in systems, borrowing from nature, and [Noah Smith](/notes/Noah%20Smith.md) also advocates for diversity.
