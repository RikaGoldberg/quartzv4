What I have realized is this: as more writing opportunities take shape, (which I am already experiencing), I need a system to help me produce quality writing, and to produce it efficiently. Efficiency is really important for me because I do not want to be miserable spending hours each day beating my head against the computer, trying to pound out words to finish writing projects - and, I also donâ€™t want to write trash writing just for the sake of output.
