**Summary**

We need to support the middle class. There is a broad group of people who have opportunity. Their parents didn't teach them to have confidence. They didn't go out into the world and achieve. But we should find those people and raise them up. Support them. Our current system is winner take all games. If I win, you lose. 

**Quotes**

> there are a lot of talented people out there whose abilities never get discovered because no one ever told them they should aim high, or because they didn't have parents to push them, or because they simply lacked confidence.

>So our system is so focused on setting up these tournaments for ambitious people that we fail to go out and nurture the ambition of people who have undiscovered talent.

>In America we're so focused on screening for the top talent that we often miss our opportunities to uplift the broad base. As a result, we've been losing middle-skilled jobs, our society is polarizing, and we're losing our industrial base.
>We need to refocus on uplifting and utilizing the broad middle of our society.

>I feel that the Thiel Fellows program isn't the kind of thing that can scale up -- it's not a call for the average person to eschew college to be an engineer or technician, it's a call for a tiny thin sliver of the ultra-elite to eschew college so they can get a head start on amassing vast wealth in winner-take-all markets. And on some level, that still assumes that we live in an Atlas Shrugged world, [see Ayn Rand](/notes/Reading%20list) where a tiny number of geniuses produce the value and everyone is still along for the ride. Maybe it really is that way, but I don't think so.

>A successful society rests on a broad foundation of human capital; it does not place all its hopes on a thin sliver of genius. I see too many people in Silicon Valley -- both liberals and conservatives -- tacitly accept the notion that only a few people have real potential. And maybe that's because venture-funded software is such a winner-take-all market. I don't know. But that's not the attitude that will bring this country a broad industrial renaissance or social revitalization.
