Meta-governance as a service is popping up e.g, Index. 

https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/governance-house/4065

>Today, there are many DeFi communities that struggle with voter apathy, optics around decentralization and having to choose between working on large system upgrades or more operational day to day changes. Governance House intends to help communities to become more [decentralized](/notes/Decentralization.md) by supporting smaller operational upgrades needed to maintain existing DApps. This helps free up the core teams to focus on leveling up from V1 to V2 to V3 etc…

>Governance House intends to optimize for voting, coordinating, writing and submitting governance proposals to implement welcome change within DeFi. Governance House will become a trusted partner with defi that will be known for acting in the best long term interest of the community/ecosystem.

>Governance House provides MaaS across DeFi through collaboration with some of the largest names in the ecosystem. Governance House will have sufficient INDEX voting right to meet quorum, whilst also having additional delegated voting rights to other protocols which enhances the metagovernance reach beyond just Index Coop’s influence.
