I have been here before. The feeling of the vast unknown. A fear. No guideposts and existential dread about how I am going to revise my draft. 

Hammad's feedback was that the organization needs work. The story jumps around too much. 

Hammad sent some videos for me to review about self-organization and sub daos. It's good thought leadership and I should look at them, for sure. And then figure out how to plug them int the piece.

What helped a lot was [[Beccy Lee]]'s  advice to create a summary. Via the summary, I saw the areas of confusion. 

Permanent notes need to be created from the summary. Outline is just good enough. 

Yalor's feedback is to separate into 2 stories: DAO Wei as intro and then Metafactory.
