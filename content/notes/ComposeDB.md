A [decentralized](/notes/Decentralization.md), [composable](quartz/content/notes/Composability.md)graph database to build [Interoperable](/content/notes/Interoperability.md) applications on Ceramic

* Graph database - Store and query data from a powerful graph, similar to Neo4j’s property graph database
* Easy to use – Write your models as GraphQL schemas and connect your app using intuitive GraphQL APIs
* Data composability – Reuse models from the marketplace to bootstrap your app with data, unlocking limitless data composability within ComposeDB’s open data ecosystem.
* Sign in with Web3 – Securely authenticate users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.
* Powered by Ceramic – ComposeDB is built on [Ceramic 1](quartz/content/notes/Ceramic%201.md), a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality.

ComposeDB on Ceramic powers Web3 applications and use cases, such as:

-   Decentralized identity – profiles, credentials, reputation systems
-   Social networks – social graphs, posts, likes, comments
-   DAO tools – proposals, tasks, contribution graphs
-   Information graphs – knowledge graphs, science graphs
-   … and so much more
