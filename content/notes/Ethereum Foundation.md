The [Ethereum Foundation(opens in a new tab)↗](http://ethereum.foundation/) (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) and related technologies.

The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger [ecosystem](https://ethereum.org/en/community/).

We provide [grants and other support](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about) for open source projects that strengthen Ethereum's foundations, with a particular focus on builder tools, infrastructure, research and public goods.
