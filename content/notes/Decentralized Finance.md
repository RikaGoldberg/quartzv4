### Notes
Decentralized finance is a tool to incentivize funding public goods. 

Tokenomics is designing crypto systems for value flow. 

### Personal thoughts
 I want to learn more about DeFi and get more active. It is becoming more relevant as I work with [Foster DAO](/notes/Foster%20DAO.md) and we create a path to financial sustainability.

An opportunity also came up to learn about Balancer pools through receiving iRobot.
