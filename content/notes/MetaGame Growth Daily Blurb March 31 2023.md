From [MetaGame Ceramic Builder's Grant Proposal](/notes/MetaGame%20Ceramic%20Builder's%20Grant%20Proposal.md) :
> We aim to come up with standardized [composable](/notes/Composability.md) models for profile-related data for any apps building on top of Ceramic to be able to use
	- E.G. MyMeta Profiles?? 
		- What is our vision? Like a social media profile. Because we think social  is the future. But users should be able to own their own data. If apps want to build a profile for their game or whatever, they can use MyMeta profiles. These are apps of the future...what are the apps?

> Over 1,600 web3 citizens have created MyMeta profiles (with 100% organic growth), making us one of the biggest profile-related projects utilizing Ceramic. 
> 	Wow! Would be really interesting to go through these profiles. 

> Rather than just using Ceramic as a single “decentralized identity solution”, we want to use it to **create universal schemas & plug in other major identity solutions such as [Lens](/notes/Lens.md) or  [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](/notes/Ethereum%20Name%20Service%20(ENS).md) making it into a decentralized identity aggregator**
> 	What does this mean?
