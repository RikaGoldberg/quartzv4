## [Costly Signals of Skill](https://www.flyingpenguins.io/p/costly-signals-of-skill?s=r&curius=1599)

### Highlights
Instead of following that path, I’ve worked for a number of relatively unknown startups focused on big and difficult problems I care about. I’m absolutely not com

plaining — it was via privilege that I could be in the position to make those decisions. But in order to allow more people to pursue entrepreneurial paths, we have to make the reputation system less biased, less based on wins and losses and more based on the quality of the work.

It’s also an answer to the question of “what’s the next iteration of LinkedIn” except the answer isn’t an iteration but a replacement of the existing system entirely.

Put another way, we have to resist this skeuomorphic temptation to think that everything is better on the blockchain

To get better endorsements, we have to make them costly. They need to cost time, money, or status. LinkedIn endorsements are intended to cost status, but compared to an effective status requiring endorsement — such as an email intro — LinkedIn endorsements hardly draw down your status capital at all.

But the predominant time and money based endorsements in web2 are affiliation and role. “Early at Uber” or “Product at Stripe” vibes. In other words, Stripe (a great company) clearly thinks you're worthy of their time and their money, because they are paying you to work there. The issue is that if you only have two or three shots in the crucial early part of your career, and if reputation is based on working for “winning” companies, then you’re going to go to companies with existing brands. You’re going to be less risk tolerant.

What we need is more frequent and more granular data. We can’t evaluate a slugger after three at bats - we need three hundred. This is the one liner point of this article. People will get endorsed through actions, not words, because web3 data is granular, open, and trustworthy. To give some concrete examples, here are some on-chain signals that would make high quality non-gamifiable endorsements:

If you hire me for a project, and then you hire me for two other projects in the future, you probably believed that first and second project to be successful. If we work together for many hours over a significant period of time, you probably feel I’m worthy of your time. If you fund me multiple times, you clearly believe I have done and will do good things with that funding. Etc (note that repeat signals of trust are key, and could happen via mixed sources like first we work together and then later you fund me)

At first glance this looks like the same system we have already. It is true that all of these signals are available in web2. I’m arguing that we can get them at far greater frequency and granularity in web3. There are a few key reasons for that: There’s more data. The norm in web3 is to work in multiple DAOs, and to move fluidly between roles and projects. If we can get that data on-chain, it can be a fairly constant stream of activity. It’s easier to aggregate. Composable identities (whether via dIDs or wallets) and interoperable platforms mean we can pull in data automatically. That means we aren’t limited by the kinds of signals that people are willing to manually add to the places they build their reputation. Money is more open and free flowing. Flows of money are shockingly open in web3, and while there will be much more nuance built in the future we can expect there to be far more transparency when it comes to endorsements that cost money. This isn’t just about DAOs paying people salaries, it’s about the ability to make a $50 investment via an NFT crowdfund instead of the floor being a $50k seed investment. As Balaji said, web3 makes everyone an investor.

There’s also a mountain of data you might want but can’t currently get access to, like who has been getting the most tips via a system like Sourcecred or Coordinape — data that would basically tell you who the key contributors are in a given project or DAO. To allow more applications to build on top of this interoperable graph, we need open standards and more than likely a protocol to do some of this work and produce an open graph that others can use. For more on the topic of the tipping point to interoperable data read my previous piece “Mirror and tipping point to interoperable content, social, and economic graphs.”

All of the above is basically a specific example of the app-infrastructure cycle Fred Wilson described in "The Myth of the Installation Phase." We are at the point where we need the initial valuable apps to pull the data out and do the work of structuring it for many more products to be built on top. After all, the platforms that own this data aren’t hoarding it in private vaults - that was web2 vibes.

## [Introducing Vector DAO. Crypto needs less investors and more… | by Vector DAO | Medium](https://medium.com/@vectorDAO/introducing-vector-dao-6eed7ff13aa6?curius=1599)

### Highlights
Crypto needs less investors and more builders In the age of Wall Street Bets, tech IPOs, and token listings, the power of ownership in generating wealth is now well understood. As a result, more and more people are choosing to invest instead of build. And we don’t blame them.

Vector DAO is a decentralized collective of designers, brand experts, and creatives pioneering a new way of working that tilts the scales back towards builders.

We’ve built new org structures that make it seamless for contributors to earn equity and tokens for their work. Being compensated in illiquid tokens can be risky so we protect our members by distributing the risks and upside of any one project by pooling these tokens into a portfolio shared by all our members.

Wealth is generated not through selling time, but by owning assets with asymmetric payoff.

Vector DAO only accepts equity or tokens as compensation in exchange for services provided. We’ve found that this aligns incentives between project and contributor significantly better. In startups, where speed and flexibility are critical, hourly compensation penalizes these qualities when we want to incentivize the exact opposite. Vector DAO handles the paperwork and legal structures required for our members to earn equity and token compensation. Members simply have to show up and start contributing.

Today, acquiring ownership through work means betting years of your life on a single startup in the hopes it becomes a unicorn. Meanwhile, investors can build portfolios to diversify risk and increase exposure to multiple successful companies.

The idea of 9 to 5 employment is a relic from the industrial era. Knowledge workers are like athletes, meant to sprint and recover.

Members sign up for the level of commitment they deem best for themselves. Vector DAO works with both full and part time contributors. If members choose to take time off and skip a season, that’s ok too. Unlike traditional startups, there’s no cliff with Vector DAO.


## [Botttom-up-business](https://ungated.media/article/bottom-up-business/?curius=1599)
## Highlights
But for the past year, I’ve been trying something different. I’ve stopped looking for answers in the outside world, and started searching within myself. I’ve let go of the need for certainty, and just started exploring and experimenting. As I surrender my need for control, and just show up in the world from a place of curiosity and play, my business and life keep getting better. It’s uncanny. That, my friends, is the top-down vs. bottom-up paradox.

There are a few ways to define ‘’top-down” and “bottom-up,” mostly from the realm of management and economics. But here’s how I’m defining them in our context of building an indie business.

Top-down is about attempting to exercise control over outcomes in a complex system. It's about having a clear, rigid definition of what success looks like, planning extensively to get it, then executing on said plan, with the expectation that if you work hard enough and stick to the plan, you will eventually get where you want to go.

Bottom-up is about setting off in a meaningful direction, but letting go of the need to know and control the exact steps ahead. It's about following your intuition and curiosity, and being experimental, iterative, and open to serendipity. It’s about taking lots of small, low-stakes steps, then letting results, learnings, and new possibilities emerge from your many interactions with the world.

But the issue comes from the extreme defaults that get drilled into our collective psyche from the culture around us.

Almost all life, career, and business advice is top-down. Having a clear vision, and setting and achieving goals are practically religious doctrine in Western culture. This way of being is baked into us by our parents, our schools, our jobs, and by seemingly every book or course we consume. It’s the water we swim in, and it’s an unquestioned assumption we take into any endeavor we’re trying to succeed in.

Not only is top-down ideology omnipresent, but it truly is seductive. Ambiguity and uncertainty are uncomfortable, while we absolutely love feeling smart and in control. We crave it. It soothes our noisy psyches and makes us feel powerful and confident. And many of us, myself included, end up addicted to that feeling, and we chase it.

But after a bunch of experimentation, here’s something I can no longer deny. Operating from the bottom-up just seems to work better. It’s scarier, because it comes without the illusion of certainty. But it results in more tangible progress, more wins, more learning, more opportunities, and more fun. It results in spending more time in the world, and less stuck up in our heads. And for me, it’s resulted in a better business, and a higher quality of life.

Here's an uncomfortable truth. Many of us have no clue what will make us happy and fulfilled over the long term. Sure, we have elaborate ideas for what we should pursue—usually tied to money, accomplishment, status, security, etc. Yet many of those goals and desires don’t originate within us. We pick them up from the people and cultures around us, and call them our own.

And the thing about mimetic goals is they rarely lead you to fulfillment. It’s a cliche at this point to share stories of people climbing to the top of the corporate ladder—the path they’ve trusted all their life—only to realize they still feel empty, and that that the ladder they climbed was propped up against the wrong building all along. And it’s not just the corporate world. This happens all the time in the entrepreneurship world and creative industries.

That's why bottom-up business is so magical. Because it gives us a constant stream of real data about how things feel in the real world. When you’re in the world and experiencing something for yourself, it doesn’t matter if your experience contradicts what you’ve read in some business book. What's real for you, is real for you.

But truth is, I’ve never enjoyed launches. They’re an insane amount of work and stress, coupled with heightened (often unrealistic) expectations. Unless they’re balanced out by other revenue models, they lead to constant cycles of feast and famine. I’m already prone to burnout, and to feeling a sense of scarcity and financial insecurity. Building my business based on this model only exacerbated those problems and degraded my quality of life.

It doesn’t matter if launches are the right answer for other creators. They’re not the right answer for me. And that’s why most of Ungated’s revenue comes from coaching and membership, and it’s why I’m taking the slow and steady approach to growing everything. Because it makes my everyday life a heck of a lot more enjoyable. And the more I enjoy myself, the easier it is to play and win the long game.
