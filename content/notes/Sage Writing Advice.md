## A Swim in the Pond in the Rain, George Saunders

### 
"To put it another way: having gone about as high up Hemingway Mountain as I could go, having realized that even at my best I could only ever hope to be an acolyte up there, resolving never again to commit the sin of being imitative, I stumbled back down into the valley and came upon a little shit-hil labeled “Saunders Mountain.”_

_“Hmm,” I thought. “It’s so little. And it’s a shit-hill.”_

_“Then again, that was my name on it._ 

_“Well, yes, it is a shit-hill, but it’s my shit-hill, so let me assume that if I continue to work in this mode that is mine, this hill will eventually stop being made of shit, and will grow, and from it, I will eventually be able to see (and encompass in my work) the whole world.”
