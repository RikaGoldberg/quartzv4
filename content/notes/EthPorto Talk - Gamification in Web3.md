Gamification is  abou

Gamification should be about incentivizing behaviors that make users feel engaged, give them a sense of fun, joy, and concentration. They feel lik they are learning and getting better not just mindlessly pressing buttons or checking your app everyday because they are earning money from it. 

This is unfortunately how many gaming apps work. Users feel like they need to sign in to feed a plant or whateer but it's mindless. They aren't necessarily learning or improving themselves. The problem is that there are no game mechanics. 

Surveillance capitalism is where companies track your every move with the goal of predicting and controlling behavior...hmm sound a little like this magic circle of jane mcgonigal? 

Also, in crypto we are creating coordination systems that incentivize behaviors. Token engineering is about i

The problem is when companies start to use user data to collect information on them and sell them ads. Or try to predict their wants, needs, and desires. 

Collect data on users to understand their wants, needs, and desires to sell them tailored ads. It's a means to predict behavior. But human behavior is unpredictable. This desire to control behavior is messed up. 

Twitter seeks to increase teh addicteveness. 

The problem is in making apps addictive and that's it. This is hollow. It's not about addictivness but rather about play engagment, fun, and concentration. Not in about seeing your numbers go up and up.

Web3 has a fun spirit which is what has kept me here. We are building decentralized systems and being ideological and stuff but really it's the fun spirit that has kept me here. I love Web3 because it's fun but there's a lot of las vegas type of games and stuff that I think can be detrimental. In general, Web3 can be weird so its important to understand stuff this now. 

What I want you to take out of this presentation is that gamification - using game mechanics to get people to do stuff has good and bad. 

Let's start with a boring definition and then move on to a deeper, more fun definition of gamification. 

At it's core, gamification is the incentivization of behavior. The question is what behavior do you want people to do? Why do you want them to do those behaviors? So that they can make your company money, so that you can collect data? If your primary motivation is money, then your game will incentivize detrimental behaviors? We want to design systems that will incentivize positive behaviors in people

Gamification is about employing game mechanics in non-game activities, so like when a company uses principles from gaming to create game things. It's all different and depends ya know. 

Gamification is about motives. If a company has good intentions, then good, bad intentions then bad. 

Gamification can make your crypto project more engaging, more fun, exciting and add additional value to users. 

If you employ gamification in your dApp, people will want to use it. Every day, you are completing some task and it's more fun. You are checking in to the game. You are accessing the platform. You can become hooked. You want to be on the dapp

Gamification purely for marketing can be really cringe. If you are creating game mechanics, like Las Vegas style gambling stuff, that's super cringe

Gamification is the incentivization of people's engagement in non-game contexts and activities by using game style mechanics. 

Getting people engaged is very important -- it can boost sales, cut costs -- sorry this is very corporate speak from investopedia but I included this because a lot of Web3 companies are very corporate, in the sense that they are driven purely by making money and short term-ism. So they employ game mechanics that may not be in the best interest of users. Rather, they serve the company more than they serve the customers but masquerade as being for the users. 

The pitfalls happen when companies put profits over people and don't design systems in a thoughtful way. 

Games are a core part of being human. Games are social, bring us together, and share an embodiment of the spirit of the play. Play is not only for kids and playing games as adults is healthy and can bring meaning to our lives, feeding our soul. 

Games can be an escape of sort from the real world, where new rules are created. Oftentimes this game world can teach us lessons about the real world. They can help us to imagine new futures, new ways of doing things, or just teach us about the present world that we live in, in a more controlled way acoording to the game makers rules. 

Jane McGonigal is a games evangelist. She thinks game mechanics should be brought into the real world to make life more fun and addictive -- a "magic circle" I think the way that she sees games is a controlling, planned way of living life. A very optimized way of living life that tries to control uncontrollable variables. Which is very human. To want to control our world. nothing wrong with it unless we take it too far. Don't be a super human, just be human. 

A lot of people like to use fitness trackers like Nike or Fitbit to manage their workouts and health.

I. Gamification of Twitter - Nguyen
https://philpapers.org/archive/NGUHTG.pdf?curius=1599
>Twitter is now one of our primary venues for public discourse. But it is not a neutral or transparent medium. Twitter shapes how we interact, who we interact with, and — perhaps most importantly — it suggests specific goals for those interactions.
>Twitter shapes our goals for discourse **by making conversation something like a game.** Twitter scores our conversation. And it does so, not in terms of our own p articular and rich purposes for communication, but in terms of its own **preloaded, painfully thin metrics: Likes, Retweets, and Follower counts.**
>I would like to focus on another basic feature of Twitter — one whose importance and impacts, I think, has not been adequately appreciated. Twitter gamifies communication by offering immediate, vivid, and quantified evaluations of one’s conversational success.
>Twitter is addictive, in part, because it feels so good to watch those **numbers go up and up**. In fact, the design of Twitter and its scoring mechanisms have been significantly informed by design strategies fostered in the Las Vegas gam- bling industry — strategies which overtly seek to increase the addictiveness of their products.
>Unlike conversation in the wild, I can know exactly how well each tweet did, and I can instantly compare my overall popularity with that of any other user. This can provide all sorts of pleasures: the thrill of victory, when we see those **numbers tick up**; and the sense of long - term achievement, presented in precise and unquestionable quantitative form.
>Here, then, is an optimistic view of Twitter: by gamifying public discourse, Twitter increases overall participation, and so helps us to reap the rewards of public discourse — such as a more fully politically engaged populace.
>**I do not accept the optimistic view.** Crucially, I don’t think that gamification merely in- creases our motivation to perform an activity while preserving all the original goods of th at act ivity. Gamification increases our motivation by changing the nature of the activity. Often, the goals of ordinary activity are rich and subtle.
>Pre - gamification, the aims of discourse are complex and many. Some of us want to trans- mit information or to persuade; some of us want friendship . Some of us want to join together in the pursuit of truth and understanding. Tw itter gamifies discourse and, in so doing, offers us re - engineered goals for our communicative acts. Twitter invites us to shift our values along its pre - fabricated lines.
>What’s more, the effect of Twitter’s gamification, across the community Twitter users, will tend towards levelling and flattening the diversity of valu e s . Insofar as Twitter’s gamifi- cation motivates its users, then it will drag all of its users ’ communicative values in the same direction – towards the same metric . Gamification homogenizes the value landscape. And th is phenomenon will help explain some of the more socially toxic aspects of Twitter.
>Supporters of gamification say that it is a technology for increasing motivation. Gamification can supposedly imbue everyday activities with all the fun and excitement of a game.

>	In our case, we’ll be building a platform for **_gamified governance_** that enables DAOs to reward participants for working together and building relationships to come to the right decision for the group. **Those who vote on winning options can win tokens.**
>	First, acquisition: DAOs can reward newcomers who propose decisions and work with DAO members to vote on winning options. **Our contests become a DAO acquisition tool for people looking to get into web3, work on DAOs, and learn about the DAO itself as well as the process of on-chain governance.**
>	Second, retention: so many DAOs lose members now because they don’t build relationships, have little to do, and go elsewhere. **Gamified governance solves all three of these issues**. Because it’s only possible to win contests by collaborating with others, contributors will have to form teams to win—leading not only to long-lasting relationships but better consensus-building mechanisms to make decisions.
>	**Gamified governance operates on the principle that the best decision in a DAO isn’t necessarily the one that builds the most revenue or growth—but rather the one that builds social consensus among DAO contributors so that they remain excited and dedicated to pursue it**. What about those who can end up penalized for disagreeing with consensus? Our hope is that they’re extra incentivized to find each other and re-challenge the winners or fork the DAO to build the vision they care about. Then again, we don’t pretend this system of incentivized collaboration is right for every DAO or every decision, and that’s why we’ll leave rewards and penalties optional. **We want DAOs to have maximum modularity to build the contests they want to build.**
III. [The Gamification of Games — Real Life](https://reallifemag.com/the-gamification-of-games?curius=1599)
>If there were a common characteristic that defined all games, it would certainly not be the use of badges, achievements, and points as incentives for engagement. **Games, if anything, share an embodiment of the spirit of play — a temporary suspension of the rules of life to make space for intensities of experience: levity, rivalry, concentration, joy.**
>If historian Johan Huizinga — whose 1938 book Homo Ludens is one of the pivotal works of game studies — had the opportunity to define gamification according to his theory of play, he might have reserved the term for a “temporary abolition of the ordinary world” where “inside the circle of the game the laws and customs of ordinary life no longer count.”
>Now gamification evangelists like Jane McGonigal advocate for games to be understood as fundamentally productive, offering a set of tactics to make life under neoliberalism appear more fun and addictive — a “magic circle” we should never step out from, even if we had the choice. The concept first gained traction at the end of the 2000s within game development and marketing communities, which saw an opportunity to use aspects of games to monetize the web
>In the Wharton School of Business’s popular online course titled Gamification, the instructor professes that “there are some game elements that are more common than others and that are more influential than others in shaping typical examples of gamification.” These elements are “points, badges, and leaderboards.” These offer scores that constitute “a universal currency, if you will, that allows us to create a system where doing one sort of action, going off on a quest with your friends, is somehow equivalent or comparable to doing some other sort of action, sitting and watching a video on the site.”
>Many games have scores, of course, but typically they serve the limited purpose of determining a winner of a particular contest. Gamification takes scores as an exportable measure of qualities that are no longer internal to the game that has generated them. “Score” becomes just another word for data — a “universal equivalent” whereby life activity and behavior can be reckoned with in quantified terms. From this perspective, games are primarily a means of data production, not a more intense or rewarding form of experience. Accordingly, apps that convert activity into points are hardly concerned with improving the quality of engagement, nor are they limited to the task of encouraging it. Consider the data collection practices of prominent gamification apps such as Nike’s fitness tracker Nike+, the productivity role playing game Habitica, or the language training app Duolingo. Gamification gurus praise these apps for how they import game mechanics, while watchdogs condemn them for privacy violations.
>The use of gamification for data collection is not a secret. The professor of the Gamification course openly celebrates it: “One of the aspects of gamification is that you’re going to get lots of information potentially about your players. Information about who they are, their profile and so forth, but also tremendously granular data about what they’re doing. Every action they take in the game, potentially can be collected, and that’s a great thing.” Points, badges, and leaderboards have always been about the data and not the play.
>Achievements notifications were not features programmed by game developers to meet players’ demands, but as a requirement codified by platforms. Microsoft Xbox’s development kit defines an “Achievement” as a “system-wide mechanism for directing and rewarding users’ in-game actions consistently across all games.” [Emphasis added.] In other words, they are not conceived as part of an individual game but as part of the larger experience of “gaming” in general. Game developers in turn must design games with this logic of achievement in mind
>This data can then be used for ends that have little to do with the games themselves — exemplifying what Shoshanna Zuboff, in The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism, called a “ behavioral surplus.”
>The patent listed a number of heuristics — avatar choices, gameplay style, time spent gaming — as potentially relevant to advertisers. The system could, for instance, “display ads for pizza-hut” if “the user has been playing for over two hours continuously.” In addition to inferring pizza appetite, the system would assess players’ personality based on gaming behavior. Such metrics as the time spent bartering instead of stealing within a game would serve as a potential indicator of the player’s interest in “the best deals rather than the flashiest items.” The “time spent exploring rather than completing levels” could indicate interest in real-world vacations. The patent is careful not to claim that these correlations actually exist; instead, it merely describes a system that could collect in-game data and then discover predictors of a player’s extramural wants, needs, and desires.
>Classifying gamers based on the data obtained through games is now a multibillion-dollar industry known as game analytics. The company GameAnalytics boasts the ability to collect and analyze data on 850 million monthly active players across 70,000 game titles. Such data can be used to segment players based on their services, playing styles, locations, and demographics. But harvesting data from gamers to make broader inferences about people has a long history. So long as there are winners and losers, players can be ranked by their ability to win
>For a point of comparison, in this Wired article from 2007, the co-founder of the Soviet Arcade Museum, Alexander Stakhanov, describes public rankings in video games as distinctly western — and by extension, capitalist. In Soviet arcade games, public leaderboards were never a feature. Instead, Stakhanov says, “If you got enough points you won a free game, but there was no ‘high score’ culture as in the West.”
>In fact, every gaming platform is now designed to collect numerous data points, as their privacy policies specify. This includes account information, payment information, user content, messages, contacts, device identifiers, network identifiers, location, achievements, scores, rankings, error reporting, and feature usage as well as maintaining the right to share or resell the data to third parties. It also includes common “key performance indicators,” or KPIs, such as virality, retention, active users, and revenue per user, as well as data specific to games such as user inputs and time spent completing tasks — which, according to this analysis from IBM, include “time to complete levels, solo versus interactive behaviors, avatar selection, interaction style indicators, gender of avatar, game strategy behavior variables, game-related tweets, social network activity, language, and more.”
>Another strategy is to use in-game data to estimate a player’s “lifetime value” or LTV — the monetary value a user is expected to generate for the game developer — and adjust the game accordingly, focusing on players with the highest expected value, nudging them to continue buying game-world tokens, character modes, virtual materials, and other items. Such microtransactions not only milk profit from players through their purchases; they can also indicate what sorts of mundane virtual tasks gamers are willing to put up with and what tasks gamers are willing to pay to avoid. Intellectual-property-law scholars have argued that microtransactions can be used to estimate players’ “intertemporal discount factor,” a financial metric originally designed to assess an investor’s preference for immediate returns or delayed rewards. If a player proves willing to overspend for instant gratification, this data about the player can be sold to advertisers, and may prove especially useful when supplemented with the other data collected by platforms. Microtransactions, then, are more than transactions; they are data on top of money.
>These efforts make it evident that the principles of gamification assume that humans are no different from algorithms in how they respond to rewards. Like machine learning algorithms, humans in algorithmically controlled spaces can be nudged and reprogrammed to have better habits. **Far from making life more game-like, gamification makes human behavior more manageable and predictable, provoked by feedback loops and captured as data.**
>With psychological insight into the values, ideals, and fantasies that users are not so willing to admit in search queries, emails, and purchasing habits, games are valuable supplements to the data Google and Amazon already collect. Just as “hardcore” games have become more standardized with open worlds, achievements, and trophies, we can expect that the promised freedom and seamlessness of cloud gaming will come with increased surveillance and more penetrating monetization. If we accept the cliché “games are a series of interesting choices,” it is about time to start asking for whom.
