### Notes

### Highlights
Instead of following that path, I’ve worked for a number of relatively unknown startups focused on big and difficult problems I care about. I’m absolutely not com plaining — it was via privilege that I could be in the position to make those decisions. But in order to allow more people to pursue entrepreneurial paths, we have to make the reputation system less biased, less based on wins and losses and more based on the quality of the work.

It’s also an answer to the question of “what’s the next iteration of LinkedIn” except the answer isn’t an iteration but a replacement of the existing system entirely.

Put another way, we have to resist this skeuomorphic temptation to think that everything is better on the blockchain

To get better endorsements, we have to make them costly. They need to cost time, money, or status. LinkedIn endorsements are intended to cost status, but compared to an effective status requiring endorsement — such as an email intro — LinkedIn endorsements hardly draw down your status capital at all.

But the predominant time and money based endorsements in web2 are affiliation and role. “Early at Uber” or “Product at Stripe” vibes. In other words, Stripe (a great company) clearly thinks you're worthy of their time and their money, because they are paying you to work there. The issue is that if you only have two or three shots in the crucial early part of your career, and if reputation is based on working for “winning” companies, then you’re going to go to companies with existing brands. You’re going to be less risk tolerant.

What we need is more frequent and more granular data. We can’t evaluate a slugger after three at bats - we need three hundred. This is the one liner point of this article. People will get endorsed through actions, not words, because web3 data is granular, open, and trustworthy. To give some concrete examples, here are some on-chain signals that would make high quality non-gamifiable endorsements:

If you hire me for a project, and then you hire me for two other projects in the future, you probably believed that first and second project to be successful. If we work together for many hours over a significant period of time, you probably feel I’m worthy of your time. If you fund me multiple times, you clearly believe I have done and will do good things with that funding. Etc (note that repeat signals of trust are key, and could happen via mixed sources like first we work together and then later you fund me)

At first glance this looks like the same system we have already. It is true that all of these signals are available in web2. I’m arguing that we can get them at far greater frequency and granularity in web3. There are a few key reasons for that: There’s more data. The norm in web3 is to work in multiple DAOs, and to move fluidly between roles and projects. If we can get that data on-chain, it can be a fairly constant stream of activity. It’s easier to aggregate. Composable identities (whether via dIDs or wallets) and [interoperable](/notes/Interoperability.md) platforms mean we can pull in data automatically. That means we aren’t limited by the kinds of signals that people are willing to manually add to the places they build their reputation. Money is more open and free flowing. Flows of money are shockingly open in web3, and while there will be much more nuance built in the future we can expect there to be far more transparency when it comes to endorsements that cost money. This isn’t just about DAOs paying people salaries, it’s about the ability to make a $50 investment via an NFT crowdfund instead of the floor being a $50k seed investment. As Balaji said, web3 makes everyone an investor.

There’s also a mountain of data you might want but can’t currently get access to, like who has been getting the most tips via a system like Sourcecred or Coordinape — data that would basically tell you who the key contributors are in a given project or DAO. To allow more applications to build on top of this interoperable graph, we need open standards and more than likely a protocol to do some of this work and produce an open graph that others can use. For more on the topic of the tipping point to interoperable data read my previous piece “Mirror and tipping point to interoperable content, social, and economic graphs.”

All of the above is basically a specific example of the app-infrastructure cycle Fred Wilson described in "The Myth of the Installation Phase." We are at the point where we need the initial valuable apps to pull the data out and do the work of structuring it for many more products to be built on top. After all, the platforms that own this data aren’t hoarding it in private vaults - that was web2 vibes.
