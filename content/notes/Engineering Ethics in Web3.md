## Highlights
Our community is a technology-abled social organization committed to the application of web3 technologies to achieve human-centric outcomes

Much like traditional engineering societies we engage in research, education, and standard setting in addition to designing, building and maintaining technological solutions.

As with any emerging technology there is still a lot of uncertainty around the practice of engineering web3 enabled systems but it is already clear that these systems are deeply entangled with social and economic systems, and thus have the potential for a deep and long standing impact on social institutions.

While it remains unclear where the web3 technology stack will carry our society, we believe that this journey must be undertaken with a values first mindset.

Engineering Values according to Martin, M. & Schinzinger, R. Ethics in Engineering. NY: McGraw-Hill, 1983: (1) a primary obligation to protect the safety of and respect the right of consent of human subjects; (2) a constant awareness of the experimental nature of any project, imaginative forecasting of its possible side effects, and a reasonable effort to monitor them; (3) autonomous, personal involvement in all steps of a project; and (4) accepting accountability for the results of a project.

Engineering Values according to Pinkus, R. L. B, Shuman, L. J., Hummon, N. P., Wolfe, H. Engineering Ethics: Balancing Cost, Schedule, and Risk — Lessons Learned from the Space Shuttle. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. “The ethical engineer is one who is competent, responsible, and respectful of Cicero’s Creed II. Cicero’s Creed, engineering’s oldest ethic, directed engineers to place the safety of the public above all else.”

Engineering Values according to Wike VS. Professional engineering ethical behavior: a values-based approach. 2001 “Instead, I prefer a third scheme that focuses squarely on what is to be valued and not on questions of methodology or technical expertise

This scheme proposes that professional engineers (and for that matter, any professionals) share a commitment to these six values: integrity, respect for persons, justice, compassion, beneficence/non-maleficence, and responsibility.”

Investors, Builders, and Early Adopters of web-based cryptographically secured social and economic infrastructure and applications have a wide range of beliefs and values but some key concepts form a common thread: privacy, transparency and agency.

However, the web3 value system is native to the internet, the social institution is extra-national and openly rejects the authority of the state to regulate it. Adherents to the web3 value system adhere to regulations out of pragmatism rather than in deference to those regulatory authorities.

Let us set aside for a moment the interpretation of the engineering profession as a social institution empowered by sovereign nations to design, build and maintain technological infrastructure. Instead let’s look at the engineering profession as a social institution empowered by the public to safeguard their well-being in the face of technologies so broad and deep that they cannot hope to understand it all, and thus cannot make educated judgements regarding their own individual safety.

This reconciles with the agency aspect of the web3 value system; in choosing which systems one opts into it is possible to select for those systems one believes have been created and maintained by persons adhering to a public-wellbeing-first values system.

hough it may take time, we believe history tells us that people want to enjoy the benefits of new technology while the underlying complexity is abstracted away from them. This is only practical if their interests are safeguarded through social institutions like the token engineering commons (TEC).

Upholding a value system is a journey not a destination; it can never be totally reduced to a set of methods and procedures but drawing on methods and procedures is a good place to start.

CPS involves transdisciplinary approaches, merging theory of cybernetics, mechatronics, design and process science

While CPS predates web3, it is also plagued by ethical questions as algorithms take the role of administering policies which directly impact human activities.

However, the growing crisis of AI explainability and prediction algorithms creating self-fulfilling prophecies shows us that a level of techno-reflexivity is required to uphold a public-wellbeing-first values system.

On an even grander scale, our existing public institutions have visibly failed to address systemic challenges such as global warming and acute public health crises.
