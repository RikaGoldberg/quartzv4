Our society is focused on creating incentives for the already privileged. People whose parents instilled ambition and motivation. Even if it was overconfident. (like me)

Confidence is not the same as narcissism. Healthy confidence is knowing what you know. https://twitter.com/sbkaufman/status/1389303190932180993?s=20&t=zGkrNRfuP62NzaETJmjxSg

What to do about overconfidence?
I. Overconfidence is a cognitive bias that is a result of miscalibrated subjective probabilities. A person thinks an event is more likely to happen statistically speaking, or their performance is higher than it actually is. 

Good thing: in 100 years, all new people. We should be targeting Gen Z, young kids in creating solutions to help with spread of misinformation. 

Education comes to mind. 
II. Overconfidence is necessary for entrepreneurs, for crypto. 

Do we underestimate the power of collective consciousness? 

We need a way to measure the validity of our own skills and other peoples skills and then get people up to skill. 

Do credentials accurately reflect skills?
