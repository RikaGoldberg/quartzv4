#quotes 
When the shoots are or four or five inches long, you can plant them in the ground or a pot filled with good quality potting soil. Repotting is important because if you just keep the root ends in the jar, they will produce green shoots for a while but the plant will weaken eventually and stop producing.

Snip off what you need, cutting the leaves all the way to the ground; the onions will continue to grow again from the cut end. If you don't cut the greens down to the ground, the plant could get to be much larger than the green onions you find in your grocery store. If they flower, you can use the flavorful blossoms in salads.
