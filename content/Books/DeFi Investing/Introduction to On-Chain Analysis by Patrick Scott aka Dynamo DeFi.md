![[Introduction to On-Chain Analysis v3.pdf]]
### Notes

- On-chain analysis separates the pros from the amateurs in crypto
- DeBank's "Web3 Social Ranking" is used to find wallets with large portfolios (whale wallets) eg. $57 million portfolio
- Watcher's Pro is helpful for finding VC wallets. More digging in can be done on Arkham where you see exchanges & counterparties VCs use. Helpful to understand 2nd order effects of a crash
- **Steps to track whale wallets:**
	- Go to debank & type wallet address or name
	- Click "follow" to start following the address

- I briefly played around with DeBank & Zapper. Unfortunately to see the change in a wallet's address on DeBank requires a premium account. 
- Zapper seems to be better with wallet identification, meaning users add their ENS names and a description to their bio. eg. I was able to see thru Zapper that a whale account belongs to Robinhood. And that another whale account is an "OG crypto trader since 2015". I could not tell this on DeBank. 
- Arkham allows you to see the change in balance and profit/loss of an account. Although I am confused about how profit/loss is calculated. 
- Arkham visualizer is cool but I don't know how to make meaning out of it
- Arkham emailed me guides which I think would be useful to go through
