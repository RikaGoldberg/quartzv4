One of the biggest stories in crypto is about how [DAOs are emerging as powerful new economies](/notes/DAOs%20are%20emerging%20as%20powerful%20new%20economies.md)
  
But how do you build an economy within a DAO? 🙃  
  
[@HelloShreyas](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) came to CCS recently to show us how it’s done.  
  
Read on for takeaways 👇

Shreyas Hariharan is co-founder at [@llamacommunity_](https://twitter.com/llamacommunity_), which builds economic infrastructure for DAOs.  
  
Llama has worked with leading DAOs including [@AaveAave](https://twitter.com/AaveAave), [@Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) [@gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin) [@PoolTogether_](https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_), [@feiprotocol](https://twitter.com/feiprotocol), [@FWB](https://twitter.com/FWB), [@dYdX](https://twitter.com/dYdX), [@radicle](https://twitter.com/radicle), and [@harvest_finance](https://twitter.com/harvest_finance), among others. 

Shreyas referenced the book "How Asia Works" by Joe Studwell, which details the economic models implemented by Asian governments including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China, and others to create successful economies.

The strategies cited in the book are land reform, immigration policy, import/export policy, protection of local industry, currency protection, special economic zones, and tax incentives. 

Friends With Benefits is an example of a token community that applied strategies of successful Asian economic models to DAOs.

[**Friends With Benefits**Where Crypto Meets Culture](https://www.fwb.help/)[https://www.fwb.help/](https://www.fwb.help/)

Here are a few examples through FWB:  
  
- Token distribution and ability to earn through contributions (land reform)  
  
- A token-gated membership (immigration policy)  
  
- Liquidity provisioning and treasury diversification (currency protection)... 

- FWB cities & gatekeepers & radio (special economic zones), and  
  
- Funding from the DAO treasury (tax incentives) 

Today, most protocol DAOs allocate 40-60% of native tokens to a community treasury, which is then allocated via on-chain governance.  
  
The challenge is that on-chain governance is slow and ineffective, which means hardly any tokens get allocated. 

However, the rules for allocating native tokens over time can be encoded in the beginning of the formation of the DAO.  
  
By setting these rules, DAOs create a game that builders, users, market participants, and other stakeholders can participate in to receive native tokens. 

[#Bitcoin](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/Bitcoin) provides a great example of this idea in action.  
  
While the model is not without its critics, it established a transparent way for market participants to earn Bitcoin that has been very successful. 

.[@CurveFinance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance) is another example of a protocol that has a very transparent system for distributing native tokens, rewarding participants, and creating utility for those tokens. 

DAO alliances are an important piece of building the DAO economy. These alliances are closer to nation state alliances than corporate M&A.  
  
A significant D2D token swap is like the NATO agreement, which partly serves to protect each other and not step on each others' toes. 

.[@iearnfinance](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance) is a good case study – they've helped several protocols like [@picklefinance](https://twitter.com/picklefinance), [@RariCapital](https://twitter.com/RariCapital), and [@AlchemixFi](https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi) when they were exploited.  
  
This helps Yearn build trust with other DAOs. 

Successful collaborations will involve product integrations, sharing of resources, support during attacks, and increase in the economic value of both DAOs.  
  
Collaborations will also involve participation in each others' governance. 

The financialization of everything (from protocols to memes to income) combined with the ability to exchange anything for anything else via decentralized exchanges like [@Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) and [@SushiSwap](https://twitter.com/SushiSwap) indicate that we are entering a loosely-defined barter economy. 

When exchanges become more common (and more important to the economy), liquidity also becomes more important.  
  
It’s easier than ever to create an asset out of anything, and it’s also easier than ever to exchange assets for each other. 

A useful analogy is that what bandwidth provided to the Internet age, liquidity provides to the blockchain age.

Bandwidth is the rate at which data flows across the network, and liquidity is the ease with which you can exchange your asset for something else.  
  
Having ample amounts of both is what allowed their respective economies to flourish. 

🎁 Gift economies seem to be emerging in intra-DAO interactions.  
  
As trust builds within a DAO, members cultivate trust that they will at some point be rewarded for their efforts to advance the mission of the DAO. 

There is value to having permanent capital because some projects require a longer time horizon and an inexhaustible source of funding.  
  
DAO treasuries often fund long term, open source projects, which means the funding will need to last as long as possible. 

DAOs are interesting because they contain elements of both socialism and capitalism, two different ideologies. 

There’s a hybrid model emerging from both the libertarian leaning beliefs that everything can be financialized, and that money shouldn’t be controlled by any centralized entity AND the leftist view that labor should own more of the economy, not just wages. 

It’s why web3 contains a multitude of political views.  
  
People can be attracted to it for different reasons and both sides can be right. 

In many ways, DAOs offer a better model for coordination and distribution of ownership than some of our existing structures.  
  
But they require thoughtful design. 

tl;dr  
  
Successful DAOs build a thriving internal economy that drives their mission.  
  
They should be intentional about how they use their native tokens and treasury to sustain and grow their communities.
