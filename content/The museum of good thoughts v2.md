Prior version: [[content/content/The museum of good thoughts]]

Summary:
A society where people are rewarded for having positive-sum thoughts (helpful thoughts that benefit others). Solaris, a woman who lives in this society, has an AI/VR headset (brain computer interface?) that she plugs into. A scan is taken of her thoughts and they are uploaded to the museum's cloud. The museum's curator reviews all of the uploaded thoughts and picks which ones will go on exhibit. Submissions are being collected and the museum's curator will pick which thoughts will be displayed for the whole world to see and revel in. 

Characters:

Solaris - loving and nurturing submission winner, chosen as the one whose thoughts will be displayed. 

Museum curator: friendly lady who has worked through her own issues and accepted them. 

Is this a utopian society? Since we're modeling good behavior and rewarding positive thoughts. 

What happens to people with bad thoughts? That's not the focus. 

What is the reward? You go to the museum on display, external reward, and you're paid for it. Other people can plug in to your thoughts using a [[content/content/brain computer interface]]. 

**Story:** 

Dear Readers:

For the last several months, I have been participating in Season 1 - a program through [Foster](https://www.foster.co/), where I have been exploring my untold truths with a community of writers.

I believe that the world, always, but especially right now, needs more positive content, and it needs more fiction - as fiction is a powerful vehicle to explore and share different realities, different truths.

I hope you enjoy this piece of flash fiction that I wrote titled: _The Museum of Good Thoughts._

Today was the big day. Solaris was waiting for this day for a long time.

Someone else was waiting too.

Solaris put on her headset and plugged into cyberspace.

"Hello Mrs." a friendly female voice came through the headset. "Who do I have the pleasure of meeting today?" the voice continued.

"Solaris. My name is Solaris. Or at least that is what I call myself."

"Stupendous! My name is Madame Millieux, but you can call me Milly. I am looking forward to our time together today. Let's get started."

_Solaris let out a long exhale._

Madame Millieux typed in a few lines of code into her console and a small blue dot appeared on Solaris' screen.

"Click on the blue dot, my dear." Madame said.

Solaris clicked on the blue dot. A whooshing tunnel opened up.

"Follow the tunnel, my lovely. We shall meet very soon."

Solaris had worked on her avatar for a long time. She didn't want to purchase a stock avatar like many of her friends. Instead, she created her own custom avatar, choosing each accessory carefully, creating a character that she resonated with deeply with, who she could use in cyberspace as a vessel to explore her deepest hopes, fears, and dreams.

Solaris walked through the whooshing tunnel. She saw Madame Millieux, a short, stocky woman, with thick curly hair, and small glasses that covered her large green eyes. She was wearing a bright red rain jacket and carrying a small umbrella.

There was a chance of rain in the forecast.

_Solaris took another long exhale._

A new window opened on Solaris' computer screen, with tiled rows of art, beautiful and colorful.

"This..." Milly began to say, "is the museum's art collection, one of the best and brightest in all of cyberspace. As the museum's curator, I am very excited to feature your work in our latest exhibit."

_How exciting! Solaris said to herself._

Her headset lit up, with all of the different colors of the rainbow.

"Come. Follow me, my dear" Madame Millieux announced. "Oh, but just one moment. I need to move my umbrella. It sometimes gets in the way."

Lights started to flash on Solaris' screen. Her headset began to vibrate.

Madame Millieux smiled - gently, kindly.

"Okay, now. The [[content/content/brain computer interface]] is ready to extract your best, most positive thoughts for this exhibit. I know you have it in you. You can do it. Make us all proud, Solaris."

"Of course." Solaris knew she had it in her. She was training for this moment for years - practicing the art of meditation, writing, and gratitude.

Solaris winked, and the curve of a smile pixelated through her avatar's lips.

"Beautiful! Great job!" Milly exclaimed.

Milly let out a small, happy, belly laugh. She knew that Solaris' art would be a big hit with museum goers, and immensely valuable to the exhibit. And after a long day of good work, she was ready to rest and recharge.

She would need her energy for tomorrow, which, she could already tell, was shaping

up

to

be

a

great

day.
