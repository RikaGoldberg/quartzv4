***Very very early thoughts**
> Interesting, eh, how people will spin your needs to satisfy themselves. Like I need to "put aside" my feelings. Compartmentalize, be the "bigger person." No, I don't. I don't need anyone's permission. 

>When you play nice, you become a pawn.

> Why is "nice" bad? Maybe it's not nice that is bad, but nice at the sake of your own needs. i.e. nice to appease someone. For example, with Sandhya, I was not game to meet up with her. Just didn't want to and I don't see any friendship forming or maintaining with her so why meet up? Just to vent about Alex .. that's not a good use of my time. So I am giving up my time to her. IDK. I think she's a good person but I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER. I wanted it only when Alex and I were together because it's a friendly and helpful relationship to have. I wish my relationship with her could have blossomed too. I would like that. But now that Alex and I are over she's over too. Basically, alex has a lot of unresolved emotional issues that screw his relationships. I wanted to be a helpful partner but he has low EQ so out with him. 

**What does this have to do with permissionlessness?**

Umm blockchains are permissionless. Anyone can join. Can spin up a node. Can start to contribute. Just need to put a little work into figuring out what to do. 

The hardest part about blockchains for the normies is discovering what to do. Getting over that hump is the hardest thing. That's why important to bump up to normies. Show them what's up.
