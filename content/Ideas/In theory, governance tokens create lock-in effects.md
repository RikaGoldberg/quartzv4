The problem is a lot of people do not understand why decentralization matters. 

Uniswap is not just being "nice" by airdropping tokens to users. 

**Decentralization is their business strategy because over the long term it keeps people committed to using the protocol. Instead of switching to the next best protocol, product, community, they are locked in to uniswap because they have governance rights. They can choose revenue sharing. Engaging in governance makes you committed.** 

If you are a whale, that is. But for regular people, one token one vote, I still want to sell my tokens because I think I will be airdropped more later. 

Tokenomics is driven by liquidity providers. 

There's nothing connecting me to 404 DAO governance. There's no commitment. I can flake out on them and go work for a professional delegate. **Why am I there?**
