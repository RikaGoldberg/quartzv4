This is a good start, I guess. Talks about the problems that DAO contributors face. Which I am kind of part of ... but the thing is the people who are quoted sound like they have mental health problems and I know, I told myself, right, I need to stay away from people who have mental health probs. Burnout, etc. that is not specific to DAOs ... in any industry, you can recognize your problems and be self aware to do better .. 

I was thinking of including this in my newsletter .. like hey, this is a good thing to read.. add it on. 

Particularly for me I was drawn to how DAOs are freelance 3.0.
