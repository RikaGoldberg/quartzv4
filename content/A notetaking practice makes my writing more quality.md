#notetaking 

Since making another attempt at building a notetaking system, I have noticed that I am becoming more scrupulous of my writing.

 I want to build something that will help me think so I can flesh out ideas and write meaningful content to help myself, and my readers, understand the technological trajectory we are on. My job as a writer is to help people feel and imagine different possibilities so that all of us, together, can shape the future and move in a positive direction.
