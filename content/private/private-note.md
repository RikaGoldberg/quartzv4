Since returning from my trip to Atlanta, I have felt sad, angry, and irritable.

Today, I looked at my jar of awesome and poop and this realization surfaced: **the things I wrote down are distractions from real problems**. For example, in the poop jar, I wrote: "impulsively checked my phone at 1030pm at night." Who cares? 

In the awesome jar, I wrote: "through anxiety comes sense making" and "in awe at my emotional progress."

**Despite the personal growth, I am unable to handle injustice in the real world.** 

Work used to be a distraction from facing relationship problems. I still use it as a distraction now. As a control mechanism. <---this sounds masculine. 

I feel overwhelmed. I think this is the feeling of lack of control.

Vitalik Buterin:

Being mean to Russians _outside of Russia_ is the most strategically senseless and mean of all. Russians living in Western countries are much more anti-Putin than Russians as a whole, and people who are _leaving_ Russia right now are particularly likely to hate what's going on in their country. What do you want to do: welcome them with open arms, or make them feel unwelcome and reinforce the ethnonationalist narrative that you have to be loyal to your blood because ultimately anyone else will throw you away at a moment's notice? If you want to cripple the Russian economy (a dark goal but at least an understandable one if you want to cripple Putin's long-term military capability so he can't invade any more countries), you _want_ to give as good an experience as possible to smart and talented people who choose to stop being part of it.

This is why I just completely cannot comprehend things like Visa and Mastercard making their cards not only not work inside Russia, but also stop working abroad for Russians. How are Russians _supposed_ to experience freedom and democracy if they get that kind of experience as soon as they step outside the country?

I did enough today, but it feels like I could do more. I want more. I feel sad. I don't have to snap myself out of it. 

I could smoke weed, but then I'd just go back to me. 

I feel unmotivated. I feel like something ominous is around the corner. I feel fear. 

Hide your children. Hide your wife. Moloch's power is coming at you. And all we have is ourselves. Ayn Rand is all about that.
