[[ayn rand]] is anti-altruism, very strongly, because she thinks it makes some people victims and others "profiteers" of victims (the ones who try to help.) She makes it seem like a parasite relationship where the two need each other. It's aligned to her belief that we shouldn't care about suffering because by caring about it we are encouraging altruism. Caring about suffering creates altruism. Instead, we should ignore **create** solutions to cure the disease of suffering, like creation has done so many times in the past and relieved suffering.
