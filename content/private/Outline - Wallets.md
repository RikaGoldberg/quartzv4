Beginner level explanation of wallets. Overview of the different wallets out there. 

==My goal for this newsletter is to provide practical insights into using Ethereum protocols and products _safely_. You will surely fail, as one does when learning anything new, but you will, most importantly, fail safely.==

**Title Ideas:** What is an Ethereum wallet? An overview of Ethereum wallets.

**Introduction**
I. What is an Ethereum wallet?
It's a user interface for accessing your cryptocurrency so you can send and receive money and access application. It's a different frame/paradigm that's unlike a physical wallet or a bank account. A physical wallet has credit cards. A crypto wallet also has accounts that you can create. That first account creation is the public/private key with your seed phrase. Then you can create more accounts but they're all linked to the top account (*probably can exclude this, it's a little too technical*)

II. Basic Mechanics of an Ethereum Wallet
- Public Key Cryptography
	- public & private key
- EOA 
- Seed phrases
	- Mnemonic
	- Bip39, Bip32, Bip44
III. Wallet Recommendations
- You probably want some recs (and want to not get rekt!) My guess is that you've heard of at least one of the four wallets that I will recommend! 
II. Wallet evaluation framework
- Open source
- Self custody
- Permissionless (anyone can sign up)
- Audited, code available for anyone to review
	- Public bug bounty
- Battle Tested
II. The different wallets available?
- Metamask 
- Rabby Wallet
- Coinbase Wallet
- Brume Wallet (cupoJoseph) - low fidelity-ish i'm not sure if appropriate for this audience
B. There are browser extension wallets
- Metamask - OG. First one. Has portfolio.
- Brave - I've tried it to try a new browser extension wallet. I use brave so I tried their wallet.
C. Hardware wallet
- For long term storage
