Growth Challenges 10 (challenge cognitive distortions) ,9 (ditch perfect), 7 ([[content/content/healthy assertiveness|practice healthy assertiveness]])

The following three cognitive distortions resonated with me the most: mind reading, emotional reasoning, and outsourcing happiness. 

As I was coming up with examples, one recent example stood out the most. (I wonder if this is a recency bias?) I caught myself in a thought pattern: unhappy and dissatisfied that I am only writing about one example. I know there are more, and I know if I spend more time thinking about it, I can come up with and write about more examples. I am labeling this desire as the need to be perfect, rather than content with just good enough. I don't need to rack my brain and spend a long time coming up with more examples, right now. I can keep coming back to this exercise. 

The example: last night, my mom and I were talking and she asked me a question. I'm not sure what prompted it - maybe a previous conversation she started where she told me about some new girlfriends she made. My mom asked if I have girlfriends in Berkeley who I can just chit-chat with about nothing. I felt like I started to mind read and my emotions told me it's not safe to have an honest conversation with her because she may criticize me and invalidate my behavior. The honest answer is that I don't choose friends based on if I can chit-chat about nothing with them. But I know that she likes to do that with some of her girlfriends. I know that I wasn't clear in communicating with my mom, and if I were to be, I would want to practice assertive behavior by expressing my feelings honestly, while also allowing her feelings to be just as valid, and both of us keep our self-respect.
