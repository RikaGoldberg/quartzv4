[[ayn rand]] talks about the creator, who originates, and the parasite who borrows. this goes against the grain of "great artist's steal" and standing on the shoulders of giants. it's a very ego look at the world, a way to crush souls and become angry and frustrated and destroy, like the character's in her book do.
