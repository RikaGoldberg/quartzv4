The Metafactory story, on a meta level, is all about systems structure and design. 

I started by leveraging ideas from Donnella to come up with 6 principles, the DAO Wei, fundamental truths about how DAOs work. 

Peter and Hammad were thinking about this too, as they experiment with organizational design aka system design. 

We must design DAOs according to good systems principles, so work can be done efficiently, effectively, globally, collaboratively, and at scale. 

Clearly**, I am super curious about system design. We can look to nature to design systems. The Internet is already designed that way. Networks, too. Social networks use systems principles. Architecture is really important, scaffolding. These ideas have been circling in my mind and I've put them together pretty cohesively!**
