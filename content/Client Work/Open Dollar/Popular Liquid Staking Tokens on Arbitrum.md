- [[Staking ETH, A lay of the land]]
	- The purpose of liquid staking is to unlock liquidity in staked ETH by creating a financial product: a [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/derivatives-101.asp). Similar to any other type of derivative traded on traditional financial exchanges, a liquid staking derivative represents some value of the underlying staked ETH.

	- **Tenderize**
		- https://whitepaper.tenderize.me/introduction/why-tenderize
			- Tenderize Labs believes the Web3 movement is about internet users taking back their well-deserved digital sovereignty. For this to happen, **a ==credibly neutral== layer of the internet** is required. This layer is currently being built on top crypto networks that feature a **decentralized validator set.**
			- [[Credible Neutrality and Foundations]]
				- Credible neutrality is dependability. It means a stakeholder (e.g a user or a developer) can use or build on a protocol with confidence it will [not change against their interests](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/)
	- https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tenderize-v2-testnet-is-live-liquid-stake-your-grt-and-lpt/19594
		- Tenderize is a fully permissionless liquid staking protocol allowing users to liquid stake GRT and LPT with validator-specific LSTs. Tenderize enables liquid staking without compromising a **decentralized validator set**, delivering a liquid staking experience as **close to native staking** as possible.

			- "Using a validator-specific LST approach of Tenderize v2, proof-of-stake networks can enjoy liquid staking without compromising validator decentralization or censorship resistance."
			- "Demand for liquid staking is on the rise, but there is a major problem - liquid staking solutions of today actively centralize the network’s underlying validator set. When this happens, the censorship resistance of the network is at risk."
			- "Without censorship resistance, there is no guarantee that a third party won’t modify transactions on the network. The immutable and unstoppable attributes which stem from the decentralized validator set drive demand and value for the network's native asset."
			- "One part of the Tenderize ecosystem is the TenderVaults - a protocol that mints validator-specific ERC20 tokens representing stake and accrued rewards, called tTokens. Instead of funneling stake to a whitelisted set of validators, users select which validator they want to stake to."
