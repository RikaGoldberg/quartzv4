Potential Title - FTX Debacle Part II, Shady Shenanigans in the Bahamas
* FTX loaned money to Alameda collateralized by a token that they created out of thin air (no different than most crypto token), and didn't liquidate  the loan when FTT came crashing down (this is different than defi protocols). 
* Most DeFi protocols have rules built in that when the collateral falls below a liquidation threshold, the protocol automatically liquidates your loan, auctioning off the collateral.
* As a borrower, you can avoid liquidation risk by depositing more collateral assets when they go down. 

- FTX experienced a solvency crisis when FTT tanked and customers started to withdraw deposits
	- "A responsible cryptocurrency exchange shouldn't really be able to run into a liquidity crunch. Every asset in anyone's account should be sitting in the exchange's various crypto wallets and bank accounts." https://www.axios.com/2022/11/12/ftx-terms-service-trading-customer-funds
	- FTX is not a trading firm! Customer deposits should not be given out. 
- FTX & Alameda, SBFs affiliated trading firm, comingled funds when Alameda lent half of its funds to FTX
- In 2019, C. Zhao (CZ) of Binance bought 20% of FTX for $100M but in 18 months, the relationship went sour when CZ started to see it as a competitor. SBF bought the shares back for 2B in fTT
- Alameda made a bunch of bad deals e.g.,  $500M loan agreement with Voyager, which went bankrupt, then paid 1.4B for its assets in auction
- FTX propped up Alameda by giving them 4B in assets, 4M of which were cusrtomer deposits (this was explicity against terms of service)

- Coindesk leaked a balance sheet that showed Alameda's 14.6B in assets were held in FTT
- Then CZ said he would sell its entire share in FTT, worth at least 580M. The token price collapsed 80%
- Then CZ said he would rescue FTX. Then he reneged.
