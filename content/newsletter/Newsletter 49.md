Shit. Writing every day is hard. The good part is topics/ideas seem to come easier to me and I have generally less anxiety about writing. I know that my writing is not set in stone. I also feel more trust with myself for writing things that are authentically me. 

As someone who spends a lot of time online reading, synthesizing, chatting in Discords, and creating content, I am intrigued by Twitter. 

I used to use Facebook a lot, but I have been completely off of it for close to a decade. I stopped using FB because it seemed superficial. I was obsessed with likes and notifications and comments. I would post the good parts about my life and look at other people's good parts. Sure, some people posted sad things too like deaths, funerals, deep feelings, but I wasn't really into that back then. My intention was to look at other people's good, and bad i guess, and just be there. 

But a part of me also knew that FB was a time suck. I read those narratives. I knew it was bad. And when I got into crypto, people talked about how bad FB is. Many people in crypto continue to hate Zuckerberg and FB because of unethical decisions it has made - from genocides to political campaign rigging like russia to working with russia. 

IDK. Twitter has plenty of bad shit like how it gamefies communication. 
FB started gamifying communication, making us little monkeys and dwarves. I think there are people on fb who post vulnerable things. There have to be. 

My people now are no longer on FB. They are on Twitter. That's the truth. So I feel like i need a presence on it. Its also a good source of information. People have certain personas on Twitter. 

Human me, circa 2007-2015, used FB on the regular. 

I'm a human in 2022 so I use social media. I used to use Facebook - my friends and family were on it. But then I read some narratives about how FB is evil, elections, genocides, tristan harris,  so I stopped using it. Plus, I found myself feeling like I was wasting time mindlessly commenting and liking and posting my own updates and seeing how many likes there are. 

Human me, circa 2020s, uses Twitter on the regular. It's a way for me to gather information, participate in discourse, and quite frankly, build my personal brand. As a person who writes on the Internet, having a Twitter is important. I can use it to poll for opinions, do quick surveys, and publish things people care about. And also read things that i care about. People suggest books, videos, movies. I affiliate with certain types of people so I read their stuff. 

I'm running an experiment now to use Twitter more. Here, it's in my garden, along with the two other experiments i'm running. I'm on Day 3 and I have already failed with phone and theme. But like Brene Brown says, when you're vulnerable, you will fail. Not you may fail. Or you can fail. But you will. She tells this to silicon valley leaders who want to have vulnerable conversations with their teams but are scared. How do you do it, they ask her? 

My intent with phone was to get into flow state more and not get distracted. But sometimes during breaks, I use my phone. Although today, I've brought awareness to it and i'm better. 

Themed days, well, monday i wrote. tuesday, i wrote. both days i read. it takes a lot of time. i also had some meaningful conversations with friends who i'm in daos with (mochi) - more accountable for my time?
