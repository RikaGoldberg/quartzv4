 > I'm a finance writer, but I never read finance books. I read history/biology/biography, and in that process, I'm constantly looking for things outside of finance that remind me of finance. I think it's hard to come up with stories if you're only reading/thinking about your own field. It's when you connect the dots from other fields that it gets exciting.
		**_‚Äî Morgan Housel, Partner at The Collaborative Fund and Author of Psychology of Money_**

Synthesizers are people who connect the dots between seemingly dissimilar information. [Morgan Housel](https://www.morganhousel.com/) is one of these people; [Tom Morgan](https://thekcpgroup.com/insights) is another.

In [_The Attention Span. The Greatest Thing by Far_](https://thekcpgroup.com/insights/the-attention-span-the-greatest-thing-by-far-1), Tom includes a quote from Aristotle:

> _The greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor [a combiner of ideas]. It is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others; it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies_ **_an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars_**_‚Äù._

Financial writing has historically lacked synthesizers: people who connect the dots between ideas and concepts that are, at first glance, seemingly unrelated to finance.

Tom and Morgan identified the problem and dove straight-in to fix it, writing interesting and exciting content that was about finance ‚Äî but, at the same time, not about finance.

This results in writing that tickles the intellectual fancy of readers because it‚Äôs exciting and fun, and it can even be spicy. üå∂Ô∏è

Synthesizers like Tom and Morgan add value by helping their readers find alpha. Not in the traditional sense of alpha as a return on an investment, but in a more intellectually complex way. They don‚Äôt write for the people who just want quick tips and advice, or who just read headlines because they want to ‚Äúbe informed.‚Äù

No, there is a lack of substance in that hollow approach to reading.

Synthesizers write content for the type of reader who wants to think for themselves and not be told what to do. They write for the reader who wants to be surprised and who enjoys a brain tickle.

Last week, during the [Foster](https://www.foster.co/) DAO retreat, I realized that I want to create alpha for crypto curious writers. Most people in my circle are already writers ‚Äî they journal, publish articles online, write fiction and nonfiction (or both). But, they are trepidatious about crypto.

I don‚Äôt blame them. Crypto is full of weird, scammy, and spammy junk. Sadly, it‚Äôs just the way it is, and that junk is not worth the time to discuss or write about.

But, wait! Crypto is also full of wonderful, intellectually stimulating ideas, projects, and companies that Writers would really enjoy learning about. A little push from a synthesizer, like myself, is probably what they need to get their intellectual juices flowing, and to realize, for themselves, how interesting and useful (and even financially lucrative!) crypto can be.

I envision my synthesis to be a combination of curation and connecting the dots. So here‚Äôs what I plan to do:

-   I will scour Telegram and Discord Groups and blogs and newsletters (which I already do)
    
-   I will read articles and books on seemingly disparate and ‚Äúrandom‚Äù topics (which I need do more of)
    
-   I will have conversations with more, new, and different people (need to do more of this).
    

All of this with the intention of helping Writers find alpha. To reiterate, this is not alpha in the traditional finance sense of a measure of a return on an investment, but rather alpha as in _I will expose you to interesting insights and help you connect the dots._

## Some Alpha üí´

(*Create a story here, weave into some narratives of things happening elsewhere in the world, unrelated to finance)

Okay, here‚Äôs some alpha to wet the appetite. Take it hoI put this together fairly quickly, so it‚Äôs not anything revolutionary. Sorry to underwhelm. The synthesis may get better next time, but no promises. Feel free to say Sayonara and unsubscribe.

Also, feel free to reply to this post and let me know what you thought.

Okay, here we go‚Ä¶

Last week‚Äôs big news, that is continuing to play out this week, is the [Binance/FTX Drama](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/09/binance-is-strongly-leaning-toward-scrapping-ftx-rescue-takeover-after-first-glance-at-books-source/). It‚Äôs important because, at the drop of a hat, crypto markets plunged. Crypto veterans are used to this kind of volatility, but for newcomers it can be This kind of volatility is not attractive to the c

1.  DAO treasuries are at risk (again).
    
2.  Stablecoins are at risk (again).
