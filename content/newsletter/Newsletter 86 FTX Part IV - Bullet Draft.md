Why did FTX fail?
- Maybe Binance put FTX out of business
- Congressional hearing was hilarious to hear the questions the reps were asking. Each rep had 5 minutes to take the floors. Some reps understand crypto, others clearly don't, like Rep. Cleaver of Missouri asking John Ray III what he thinks about changing the name of "cryptocurrency" to "creepydoh currency". Cleaver makes this "joke?" with a completely straight face!
	- Watch livestream recording here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAnrigAO3I
	- John Ray III: This is worse than Enron because 1) there was absolutely no record keeping; 2) a multibillion dollar company used Quickbooks!; 3) there was no independent board.
- People like economist Paul Krugman say blockchain is pointless. Some old reps said that too. 
- FTX was arrested the day before hearing by US prosecutors. Conspiratorial as to why... lol
