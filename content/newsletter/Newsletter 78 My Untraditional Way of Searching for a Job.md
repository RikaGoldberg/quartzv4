Hi friends, 

If you are reading this, I need your help!

**I am looking for a Writing job in Web3** – at a VC, Startup, Think Tank, or Academic Institution. 

I am asking my friends to help me spread the word.  

So that the Internet can work its magic. 

## Web3 Storytelling is Broken

Many people in Web3 talk about how storytelling is important but few companies actually practice what they preach. 

Most Web3 companies do not craft quality stories. Instead, they go for the low-hanging fruit and write emotionally charged articles intended to make readers feel FOMO (fear of missing out) or insanely technical content that only insiders can understand, adding to the prevailing toxic narrative that Web3 is a [rich boys club](https://beincrypto.com/real-humans-need-to-shape-daos-so-they-dont-become-a-rich-kid-club/) fueled by token speculation. 

The media keeps proliferating this harmful narrative because it is profitable – outrage and hate drives readers to open click-bait headlines. 

Sadly, a lot of Web3 really is a rich boys club where [a handful of whales](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1413597760490672132) control the protocols. 

But, Web3 is also _so_ much more than a plutocracy of insiders. 

The problem is that the media has no idea because they’re not actually participating in Web3. So they focus on the tip of the iceberg stories. Stories that spur outrage, hate, and disgust, and ultimately leave readers feeling powerless and cynical.

What if instead readers felt inspired and optimistic? 

Imagine a future where a company blog inspires readers to take positive action. To get curious about the [future of the Internet](https://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html). To see themselves in [a story](https://rikagoldberg628.gumroad.com/l/metacartel) about real humans who are working to build this future. 

Humanity evolved because of our ability to tell stories. A company blog that uses storytelling creates connection, loyalty, and trust with readers, and builds a genuine funnel for readers to become customers. 

**I can help.** 

## The Shape of My Work

What fires me up about Web3 is how the space is giving rise to new tools for human organization and collaboration. The projects that I am most excited about are ones that are using technology and tokenization to build alternative ownership systems to the extractive Web2 sharing economy. 

This is why I have spent the last five years contributing to Web3. 

**For the first three years, I was a Product Manager. And for the last two years, I have been writing in public.** 

As a Product Manager, I learned how Web3 protocols and applications work. I can build and [write technical content](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-rangers/issues/88). My Github profile is available [here](https://github.com/RikaGoldberg).

As a Writer, it has been very important for me to maintain a [public digital garden](https://www.rikagoldberg.com/) where I think, develop and refine ideas before I publish long-form content. 

-   I published two nonfiction stories in a DAO anthology. The first story is about MetaCartel. The second story is about MetaFactory. The project was funded by a grant and voted on by the MetaCartel community. 
    
-   I wrote an [OpEd about DAOs](https://beincrypto.com/real-humans-need-to-shape-daos-so-they-dont-become-a-rich-kid-club/) for the BeInCrypto news publication. 
    
-   I experimented with Writing NFTs on my [Mirror blog](https://mirror.xyz/rikasukenik.eth) and on [Zora.](https://zora.co/collections/zora/9977) 
    
-   I worked with [Crypto, Culture, & Society and Culture](https://station.mirror.xyz/-vI2jhsl_EkVZ-jLdlFIXj5amwAmkClAz6y1CCyTRyw) to [write a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/CryptoSocietyS1/status/1516509915153453057?s=20&t=E_U3tIrdUhI62qF9mNPpkg) on [Shreyas’](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) workshop on _Building an Economy Within a DAO_.
    
-   I write a newsletter called [Sharing is Caring](https://www.newsletter.rikagoldberg.com/) about psychology and self-development with sprinkles of Web3 and DAOs. 
    
-   I wrote a post on [my reflections](https://interintellect.com/reflections-on-an-interintellect-salon/) after [Matt Clifford’s](https://twitter.com/matthewclifford) [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/) salon on _Lessons from The Middle Ages: Power and Territory_.
    
-   I wrote a [fiction story](https://zine.mochi.club/nonspiracy/the-bubble) for the [Mochi Zine](https://zine.mochi.club/) that was also [minted as a NFT](https://zora.co/collections/zora/2648). 
    

## Please Help Me Make the Internet Work its Magic! 

After working in Web3 for close to 5 years, I have experienced the serendipitous magic of the Internet to bring like minded people together, in community, to collaborate and achieve great things, and I want to extend that magic to my job search as well.

[Foster](https://www.foster.co/), a Writer’s collective, is a great example. 

One year ago, I started to contribute to Foster as a community member, submitting drafts for editing and also editing other members’ drafts. I became one of Foster’s top contributors and when Foster decided to press play on a long-awaited decision to form a collective, I was asked to join the Founding team.

My contributions were a testament to my dependability and commitment to Foster’s [mission](https://www.foster.co/manifesto) of investing in writers and their stories. 

My writing showed my interest and skills in Web3. 

The rest is history. 

My wish is that this post will be another stepping stone in my Writing journey. And that it will be shared amongst like-minded people, at VCs, Startups, Think Tanks, and Academic Institutions, who are hiring a Web3 writer.
