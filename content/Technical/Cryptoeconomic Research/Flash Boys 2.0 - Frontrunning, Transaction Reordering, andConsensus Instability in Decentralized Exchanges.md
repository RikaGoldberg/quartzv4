We show that MEV creates systemic consensus-layer vulnerabilities

Our results are surprising for two key reasons. First, they identify a concrete difference between the consensus-layer security model required for blockchain protocols securing simple payments and those securing smart contracts. In a payment system such as Bitcoin, all independent transactions in a block can be seen as executing atomically, making ordering generally unprofitable to manipulate.

Smart contract security is often studied purely at the application layer, abstracting away low-level details like miner selection and P2P relayersâ€™ behavior in order to make analysis tractable

Low-level protocol behaviors pose funda- mental challenges to developing robust smart contracts that protect users against exploitation by profit-maximizing miners and P2P relayers that may game contracts to subsidize attacks

Because pure revenue op- portunities offer unconditional revenue, arbitrage bots often compete against each other by bidding up transaction fees (gas) in what we call PGAs. We formally model bot PGA behavior and observe a cooperative equilibrium. We show that empirical measurements of the evolution of bot PGA strategies validate key features of our model.
