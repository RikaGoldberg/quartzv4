Decentralization protects a platform's market participants (e.g, businesses, creators, developers) from exploitation by the platform.

A pattern of cooperation followed by intense competition, exploitation, and extraction is common for centralized platforms on the Internet. This ends up hurting the end user because they, in theory, receive a lower quality service, pay more, and have less options.

[[Decentralized platforms win because unlike their centralized counterparts they don't exploit users and they don't bait and switch builders and creators]]

[[Blockchains make commitments that protect stakeholders from common Web2 risks]]
