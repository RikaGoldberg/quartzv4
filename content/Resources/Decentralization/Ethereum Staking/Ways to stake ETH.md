1. Solo Staking
- Gold standard - run a full node
	- Tactics here: https://ethstaker.cc/resources
- Requires 32 ETH
- Need basic hardware & understand minimal specs
- On software side, need to run 1 node on Ethereum and 1 node on Ethereum 2, validator software, and key manager software
- Need to do maintenance on your node
- There are [common mistakes ](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-slashing-prevention-tips-f6faa5025f50) folks make

2. Staking as a service
- Hassle-free staking experience for a reasonable fee
- Companies who provide this service:
	- Kiln - "enterprise-grade staking"
	>"While different validator-as-a-service providers may have variations in their offerings and billing processes, their core purpose remains the same: to alleviate the burden of managing a validator and provide you with a hassle-free staking experience for a reasonable fee." https://www.kiln.fi/post/comparing-staking-options-native-pooled-and-liquid-finding-the-right-approach-for-you
	- Attestant - for institutional clients
		- "it is possible, and indeed is part of Ethereum 2's design, to ensure that validators can run on low-end hardware and anyone can run a validator at home. That said, being possible does not mean it is desirable: there are significant costsÂ involved with running a validator and, as such, many people will look to a third party to operate some or all of the validator functions." - Jim McDonald, co-founder of Attestant
