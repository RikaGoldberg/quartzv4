Per Chainlink: 
[Most broadly, staking is a cryptoeconomic model that incentivizes the correct behavior of network participants using penalties and rewards in order to strengthen its underlying security](https://blog.chain.link/liquid-staking/)

Per Ethereum.org
[The term consensus mechanism refers to the entire stack of protocols, incentives and ideas that allow **a network of nodes** to agree on the state of a blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/#:~:text=Ethereum%20uses%20a%20proof%2Dof,to%20capital%20locked%20by%20stakers)

Per Ethereum.org:
[Staking is a type of consensus mechanism that derives its crypto-economic security from a set of rewards and penalties applied to capital locked by stakers. This incentive structure encourages individual stakers to operate **honest validators**, punishes those who don't, and creates an extremely high cost to attack the network.](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/#what-is-consensus)

Per Ethereum.org:
[**Node operators can add a validator** to their consensus clients by depositing 32 ETH in the deposit contract. The validator client comes bundled with the consensus client and can be added to a **node** at any time. The validator handles attestations and block proposals. They enable a node to accrue rewards or lose ETH via penalties or slashing. Running the validator software also makes a node eligible to be selected to propose a new block](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/node-architecture/#validators)
