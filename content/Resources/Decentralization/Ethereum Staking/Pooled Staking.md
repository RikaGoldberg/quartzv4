### Quotes

#### Why stake with a pool?

- Low barrier to entry
- Stake today
- Staking tokens

#### Comparison with other options

Solo staking: Stakers never have to hand over their keys, and they earn full rewards without any middlemen taking a cut.

SaaS: Rewards accumulate to the staker, and usually involve a monthly fee or other stake to use the service. If you'd prefer your own validator keys and are looking to stake at least 32Â ETH, using a SaaS provider may be a good option for you.

#### What to consider

Each pool and the tools or smart contracts they use have been built out by different teams, and each comes with benefits and risks. **Pools enable users to swap their ETH for a token representing staked ETH.** The token is useful because it allows users to swap any amount of ETH to an equivalent amount of a **yield-bearing token that generates a return from the staking rewards applied to the underlying staked ETH (and vice versa) on decentralized exchanges even though the actual ETH stays staked on the consensus layer.** This means swaps back and forth from a yield-bearing staked-ETH product and "raw ETH" is quick, easy and not only available in multiples of 32 ETH.

However, these staked-ETH tokens tend to create **cartel-like behaviors where a large amount of staked ETH ends up under the control of a few centralized organizations rather than spread across many independent individuals**. This creates conditions for **censorship or value extraction.** The gold standard for staking should always be individuals running validators on their own hardware whenever possible.
