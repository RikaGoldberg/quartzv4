>The ability to create switching
costs and build customer loyalty has also been argued
to be a major driver of success in e-commerce businesses
(Reinchheld and Schefter 2000). However, it has been
observed that over 50% of customers stop visiting com-
pletely before their third anniversary (Reinchheld and
Schefter 2000)


>If switching costs are inherently low and
firms are unable to lock in customers, long-term prof-
itability may be difficult to attain, especially in many
B2C e-commerce environments with low entry barriers
(other than customer acquisition costs) and limited dif-
ferentiation.
*Crypto has low barriers to entry. Permissionless for users. Low barriers for entrepreneur*

>As a result, it becomes critical for a firm to
manage its retention ability, which is determined by
switching costs and attrition rates. The first step for
managing retention is to be able to measure the mag-
nitude of switching cost and identify what factors affect
switching and attrition. 
	As Shapiro and Varian (1998) argue,
		You just cannot compete effectively in the information economy unless you know how to identify, measure, and understand switching costs and map strategy accordingly 

>As classified by Klemperer (1987), there are
at least three types of switching costs: transaction costs,
learning costs, and artificial or contractual costs. Trans-
action costs are costs that occur to start a new relation-
ship with a provider and sometimes also include the
costs necessary to terminate an existing relationship.
Learning costs represent the effort required by the cus-
tomer to reach the same level of comfort or facility with
a new product as they had for an old product. Artificial
switching costs are created by deliberate actions of
firms: frequent flyer programs, repeat-purchase dis-
counts, and “clickthrough” rewards are all examples.
Besides these explicit costs, there are also implicit
switching costs associated with decision biases (e.g.,
the “Status Quo Bias”) and risk aversion, especially
when the customer is uncertain about the quality of
other products or brands.

>First, the market is large and sig-
nificant and is considered to be one of the “killer ap-
plications” in B2C electronic commerce (Varian 1998,
Bakos et al. 2000). There were over 140 online retail
brokers by the end of 1999 and they managed just over
$1 trillion in customer assets in 2000. By year-end 1999,
these accounts represented about 15% of all brokerage
assets and 30% of all retail stock trades (Saloman Smith
Barney 2000). Second, as noted in the Introduction, this
industry has very aggressive customer acquisition tac-
tics, partially because of the high lifetime value of an
active account ($1000). Third, the complexity and fi-
nancial significance of a stock trade makes it likely that
consumers generally face learning costs and other de-
terrents to switching, including a difficult process of
either transferring assets or liquidating stock positions
in order to switch brokers

>In our earlier analysis, we found that attrition (custom-
ers who have a brokerage account at some time but do
not return to any broker in the future) is a significant
problem.

>It is also important to note that demographics typi-
cally are not good predictors of behavior except for a
few isolated results on attrition. One notable result is
that women are found to be more likely to become inactive. This gender effect appears consistent with a
recent study by Barber and Odeon (1999) which found
that men trade online significantly more frequently
than women, so it is not surprising that women are
more likely to become inactive

>Moreover, to the extent
that systems usage encourages retention through
system-specific learning, it would imply that firms
could improve retention by encouraging consumers to
frequently visit and use their sites. Our analysis also
suggests that systems design characteristics such as
personalization and ease of use should be reconsidered
both in terms of their measurement and in further eval-
uation to determine whether they have the intended
effects on long-term customer behavior.
