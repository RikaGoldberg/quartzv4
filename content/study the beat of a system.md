**"Before you disturb the [[content/content/system]]in any way, watch how it behaves. If it’s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat.** If it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around a long time to tell you what happened."

-   Donella Meadows [[content/content/Thinking in Systems]]
