The similarity is that children are sacrificed. Whether in Ginsburg's poem it is to 'capitalism' ..

In greek tragedies, hard moral decisions must be made. To choose between one's country or one's child. How the actors make the decision is the study of decision making.

He thought feelings were secondary in decision making.
