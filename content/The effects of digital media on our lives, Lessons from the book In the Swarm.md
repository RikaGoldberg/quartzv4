The other day, Graeme, [@strangechances](https://twitter.com/strangechances), the CTO of Mirror.xyz (this platform), wrote a popular Tweet. There’s nothing surprising about that, since Graeme writes many popular tweets, but it was one of his comments that surprised me - in a really good way.

Peaking my interest, I went ahead and purchased the book Graeme mentioned in his comment. By the way, I won’t post a screenshot or a link to the tweet, because, to be honest, I can’t find it, but it doesn’t matter. The takeaway, for me, from Graeme’s Tweet was the book, although the thread is also probably interesting and valuable, so Graeme, or anyone else, if you are reading this, and know what Tweet I am referring to, please send it my way.

Okay. Let’s get to it.

The book is called [[content/content/In the swarm]] and it is written by [[content/content/Byung-Chul Han]], a modern day philosopher and cultural theorist. The book is about the 2x the size of my hand, very small, making it for a good book to quickly browse through, perhaps while - apologies for the crudeness - sitting on the toilet. But, really, it’s one of those books that, despite its small size, is jam-packed with wisdom. The font is beautiful as well: perhaps, 12 point typescript. I’m not a designer. but I can certainly appreciate a good font, and this book has nailed the aesthetics. Originally written in German, but translated to English by Erik Butler, and published by MIT Press, this book is beautiful all-around. If there was to be a ‘best picture’ type of award for books, _In the Swarm_, would take home the honor.

At the very beginning, there is a quote from [[content/content/Faust]].

“My tears are flowing; earth, take back your child.”

I had no idea who Faust was, but I was intrigued so I did what I always do when I don’t know something: I looked it up on Wikipedia. Information at my fingertips! Sweet, sweet information. What would I have done otherwise? Paginated through an encyclopedia, probably, and flipped through page after page after page, referencing and following the bread crumbs and going and going and going. But I would have had to have this particular encyclopedia. Information would have not been at my fingertips. No, not at all. Richness and depth, I would have lost. I couldn’t click or browse endlessly. But, the art of doing nothing lady does talk about the art of library browsing.

Anyway, information vs. knowledge is the point
