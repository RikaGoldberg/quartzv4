## What Is Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)? 

Fully diluted valuation (FDV) is the total value of a cryptocurrency project considering all of its tokens that are in circulation. It is used by investors to gauge the future potential of the project, just like the total number of issuable shares in the stock market.

### Key Takeaways

- Fully diluted valuation (FDV) is the total value of a cryptocurrency project assuming all of its tokens are in circulation.
    
- The total supply of tokens may change due to the minting of new tokens, or due to token burning, which removes tokens from circulation. 
    
- FDV is calculated using the formula Token Price X Total Supply, which gives a projection of the cryptocurrency's market cap when all tokens are in circulation.

How much a cryptocurrency project’s token grows in value is the result of its technological and marketing progress. The general idea is that a technologically far-reaching project is well on its way to exponential growth. While this might be true, the token generation and distribution scheme as well as other factors contribute tangibly to this progression, all of which could potentially hinder this progress if not done well.

An increasing token supply might offset the demand and supply conditions. When the supply increases against an unchanged demand, a decrease in price per token could occur as a result of new tokens _diluting_ the total market cap. To stay ahead of this situation, a project’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is an important data point to consider.

## Understanding Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) and Why It Is Important

Fully diluted valuation is a statistical representation of the maximum value of a cryptocurrency project, assuming all of its tokens are already in circulation. It gives investors a view of the project beyond the given point.

For most cryptocurrency projects, the total token in circulation could vary constantly. Total tokens in circulation increase as more tokens are generated through mining, rewards for staking or providing liquidity, the release of vested tokens, or minting of new tokens. For deflationary tokens, total tokens in circulation decrease as tokens get [burnt](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/token-burn).

The practice of releasing a small portion of the maximum supply of its token at launch is becoming more popular in the crypto space. With a relatively small number of tokens in circulation, these projects are presumed to be ‘undervalued’ considering the current market cap and fundamentals.

As more and more tokens are released and introduced into the market, the value per token may start to drop if there isn’t a relative increase in demand. Investors who fail to consider these future supply changes might suffer losses as more tokens are sold into the market. The FDV is a simplified mathematical expression that presents data that averts this scenario.

## How to Calculate Fully Diluted Valuation

The FDV considers all tokens in supply (total supply) and not only the circulating ones. The token in supply can be obtained from the project’s documentation or CoinGecko’s tokenomics page (more on that later). This data can also be obtained from the smart contract details of tokens minted on smart contract blockchains.

A cryptocurrency project’s fully diluted valuation is obtained by multiplying the current price per token by the token’s total supply.

**Fully Diluted Valuation = Token Price X Total Supply**  
  
The total supply includes the tokens that are in circulation and the tokens pending distribution, excluding any coins that have been burned (removed from circulation). It is comparable to the total number of outstanding shares in the stock market. The fully diluted valuation gives a projection of the cryptocurrency’s market cap assuming all tokens (except those burned) are in circulation.

For instance, the value of each [EVMOS token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/evmos) is $2.70 (at the time of writing), and the maximum and total supply is 1 billion tokens. Taking this into consideration:

EVMOS FDV = $2.7 x 1 Billion  
                       = $2.7 Billion

The information from CoinGecko’s [EVMOS tokenomics page](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/evmos/tokenomics) shows various token allocations including 32% of the total supply reserved for staking rewards and another 8% allocated for the EVMOS Rektdrop program ([token airdrop](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-airdrop-and-how-does-it-differ-from-an-ico)). Some of these allocations are still vested and will be released in the future. 

Staking rewards are claimed over time by users who staked their tokens on the platform. As stakers claim their rewards, the supply of tokens will increase as more tokens are brought into circulation. The Rektdrop program runs until 30th September 2022. During this time, eligible members can claim tokens allocated to them, the circulating supply will increase as this happens.

The supply schedule above gives a view of the complete token generation and distribution timeline. The market cap doesn’t take the vested tokens into account. If the total supply was already in circulation and the price per token stayed the same, the market cap would vary considerably from the current figures. This is reflected in the fully diluted valuation (over $2.6 billion) shown on CoinGecko’s token page.

### CoinGecko's Fully Diluted Valuation Toggle

**Pro tip:** Toggle “Show Fully Diluted Valuation” button on CoinGecko to make all token’s FDV instantly accessible.

[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) introduced FDV toggle that allows you to view the fully diluted valuation (FDV) of every cryptocurrency listed on its asset tracking platform. You can view the fully diluted valuation of a cryptocurrency by toggling “Show Fully Diluted Valuation” as indicated above. The fully diluted valuation is also shown on the individual token pages.

For some cryptocurrencies, there are no FDV statistics because these tokens do not have a max supply.

We've also recently released a new metric (circled in blue in the image above) called "Market Cap / FDV". This lets you track the proportion of current market capitalization compared to the FDV. The closer the Market Cap / FDV is to 1, the closer the current market capitalization is to its fully diluted valuation. Through this feature, you'll be able to tell how far (or near) the coin is from its full unlock with all coins available to the public.
