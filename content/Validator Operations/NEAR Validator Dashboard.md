## Welcome to my NEAR Validator Node Dashboard

I operate two validator nodes on NEAR through [[Metapool's Node Studio Program]]. Anyone who holds NEAR can stake to my nodes and earn rewards. 

**Which one should you choose?** The validators are equally reliable—your choice comes down to timing and mission:

| Validator            | Node Studio Cohort |   Cohort End Date | Mission                                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :----------------: | ----------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔷 **Axia Network**  |         #1         |     July 21, 2026 | **Professional delegate participating in governance across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems** |
| 🟣 **Arteria Nodes** |         #2         | November 10, 2026 | **Women-founded collective increasing economic power of women in crypto**               |

**You can find detailed stats for each validator in the pages below.**

## ❤️ How to Stake

### Option 1: Stake Through a Wallet 

 Choose your preferred NEAR wallet to stake to Axia Network (`pool name: axianetwork.pool.near`) or Arteria Nodes (`pool name: `arterianodes.pool.near).<br> 
 
 Detailed information on each validator, including stats, can be found in the section above.

**New to NEAR?** All wallets are free and take less than 5 minutes to set up.

### Option 2: Stake through House of Stake 

I recommend to stake your NEAR or a NEAR liquid staking token (LST) through [House of Stake](https://gov.houseofstake.org/info) to unlock all of the benefits of traditional staking **PLUS**:

✅ **Additional time-based rewards** for locking NEAR or a NEAR liquid-staking token. <br>
✅ **Governance power** through delegation.  
✅ **Vote on ecosystem programs** like validator support and critical infrastructure programs. 

Your delegate is an active participant who stays informed on governance proposals and votes to shape NEAR's future. You earn rewards while your voice counts in protocol decisions.
