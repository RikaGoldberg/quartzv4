I'm Rika Goldberg — founder of [Axia Network](https://axianetwork.io), a governance advisory firm for blockchain protocols.

Axia supports leading Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems navigate decentralized governance, and operates a validator node on NEAR. A long-term goal close to my heart: helping expand meaningful enterprise and institutional participation in on-chain governance — moving it beyond a niche activity into something that shapes the future of these networks.

## Background

Before founding Axia, I worked on the governance team at 404 Gov, a company built out of the Georgia Tech Blockchain Club. I've also worked as a Product Manager across the Ethereum ecosystem, including at ConsenSys. In a past life, I was a CPA and technologist implementing enterprise resource planning systems for enterprises.

## Why I write

I believe in building in public. Sharing what I'm learning, what I'm thinking, and what I'm getting wrong is how I process my work and contribute to the protocols, projects, and ecosystems that I believe in.

This site is my digital garden — a place where notes grow over time and ideas cross-pollinate. I was inspired by the [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) community and the ethos that building in public is more valuable than waiting until you have something polished.

I also write a newsletter called **[Sharing is Caring](https://paragraph.xyz/@sharingiscaring)** — longer form pieces on crypto, governance, and decentralized finance.
