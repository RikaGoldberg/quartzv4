# Rainbow Token Launcher

## An Overview:

Rainbow Token Launcher is the easiest way to create and launch your own token on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks. Whether you want to make a fun memecoin for your friends or launch a social token for your community, we've got you covered with a simple mobile-first experience.

### Getting Started:

To launch a token, you simply need:

- A Rainbow wallet
    
- Some ETH on your chosen network for launch costs
    
- A creative idea for your token!
    

For now, you’ll need to pay network fees to deploy your token, though we are working to make this free for everyone soon. These fees vary by network. We'll always show you the exact cost before you launch. In the future, we plan to make this free.

You can launch on the below networks that Rainbow supports! And those networks are able to create incentives for deploying tokens on their network through Rainbow. Go wild 🌈

- Mainnet
    
- Arbitrum
    
- Base
    
- OP
    
- Polygon
    
- BSC
    
- AVAX
    
- Blast
    
- Ink
    
- Berachain
    
- Unichain
    
- Zora

### Token Distribution:

About 94% goes into liquidity (so people can trade it), while you get 0.5%-1% as the creator (depending on whether you enable airdrop). If you enable airdrops, 0.5% is reserved for your community. If you don't enable airdrops, you get 1% as the creator (0.5% base + 0.5% from unused airdrop allocation). You can also pre-buy tokens at launch to boost the initial price. Lastly, 5% is allocated Over The Rainbow.

When you launch your token, 5% of the total supply goes "Over the Rainbow" which is our way of saying it's held on chain (for now) and will one day be used for Future Rainbow Community Distributions. This gets your token into more hands and gives the Rainbow community a stake in projects launched on the platform while keeping most of your token's supply (94%) in the liquidity pool for trading. As the creator, you still receive your share (0.5-1%) of the total supply, with an optional portion for airdrops to your community.

##### Liquidity Pool:

When people trade your token, a 1% fee is charged on each transaction. This fee is split between you (the creator) and the Rainbow Token Launcher protocol. You get 50% of these trading fees and the protocol gets 50%. These fees come from the liquidity pool that's created when you launch your token. The more trading volume your token generates, the more fees you earn! You can collect these fees anytime through the Rainbow app, with no minimum threshold required. It's a great way to earn passive income from your creation, even if you're not actively trading it yourself.

### Trading & Prices:

Token prices are initially determined by supply and demand through Uniswap liquidity pools. This is in place of a bonding curve. If more people are buying than selling, the price goes up. If more are selling than buying, it goes down. Think of it like a digital trading card - the value depends on how much people want it!

**Y**ou can trade any token that exists on supported networks through Rainbow's swap feature. Rainbow Token Launcher tokens can also be traded on other platforms that support ERC20 tokens.

### Creating Your Token:

When creating your token, you'll be able to customize the token and create an initial total supply amount.

Your token’s “total supply” is the total number of tokens that get created when you launch your token. Rainbow uses “1 billion” as the default value, but you can customize your token’s Total Supply with any value between 0 and 1 trillion for added fun!

You can be creative with names and symbols, but we don't allow impersonation of existing projects. Also, "Rainbow" and "RNBW" are reserved (sorry! 😉).

When you launch, you can optionally buy some of your token right away. This raises the initial price, and makes sure you can get enough of your own token before anyone else does!

#### How it Works:

1. Launch the token launcher under the discover screen: 🔍 → **Launch your Coin**
    
2. Here, you can begin editing your token details along with additional fields to customize. When you’re all set, you can tap continue to finalize those token details.

### Airdrops & Community:

Before we get into specifics, an airdrop is when you give away some of your tokens to specific people like your friends or community members. It's a great way to get people excited about your token!

With the token launcher, you can easily select friends to airdrop to using their Farcaster username, ENS name, or wallet address. We also have preset groups like "Your Farcaster Followers" to make it super simple.

### Safety & Security:

While launching tokens is fun, remember that crypto trading involves risk. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and be especially careful with new tokens which can be highly volatile.

While we can't prevent all copycats, we do have measures to prevent impersonation. Report suspicious tokens to [support@rainbow.me](mailto:support@rainbow.me) and we'll investigate.

### Common Questions:

1. _**What's "gas" and why do I need it?**_  
    Gas is like a transaction fee you pay to the network. You need some ETH (or whatever the network's native token is) to pay for gas when you launch a token or make trades.

2. _**Help! My transaction is stuck!**  
    _Don't worry! Transactions can sometimes take a moment depending on network conditions. Check your transaction status in Rainbow, and if you need help, our support team is just a message away.

3. _**What's the difference between swapping and bridging?**_
    
    - Swapping is trading one token for a different token on the same network
        
    - Bridging is moving your tokens from one network to another (like from Base to Arbitrum)
