About one year ago, I decided to experiment with staking ETH. I wrote a newsletter post about it and I wanted to try out liquid staking. I read about it a ton online so finally I went for it. It took me a long time. A long time to trust what I was doing. Mostly to take the risk. 

But all I did was risk $300. It's little money. I'm privileged so its no big deal. But some people say they risk 3,000 and its no big deal. So whatever, doesn't mater. The important thing is that you risk something. You could risk $100 and still learn what's going on. Enough to where it makes a difference. 

The goal here is to learn. It's not necessarily to make money. I promise you the money will come later. I don't have children, but that's what I would teach my future kids. Try small risks, learn, and the money will come. Trust me. Clearly, this is nuanced too. 

Testnet is the best way to learn with no money. You are at risk of losing NOTHING. But you're learning. A few hundred dollars is okay too to gamble with. 

I gambled with X ETH for Y StETH. 

My aspiration is to help people make money.
