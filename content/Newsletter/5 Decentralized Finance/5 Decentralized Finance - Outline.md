**Possible Outline**

1. **Intro**
    
    - Ground the reader in today’s financial landscape: banks, fintech apps, and the trust model they rely on.
        
    - Briefly highlight the promise of DeFi: open, programmable, permissionless finance.
        
    - Position DeFi as the “onchain evolution” of traditional finance, much like your last post framed onchain social as the evolution of social media.
        
    
2. **Useful Definitions**
    
    - What is Finance (TradFi)?
        
    - What is DeFi?
        
    - Key terms: smart contracts, liquidity pools, yield farming, governance tokens.
        
    
3. **Historical Evolution**
    
    - Early DeFi experiments: MakerDAO (DAI), Uniswap, Compound.
        
    - 2020’s “DeFi Summer” boom — experimentation and excess.
        
    - Institutional interest and regulatory pushback.
        
    
4. **Key Protocols & Models**
    
    - **Uniswap**: automated market maker innovation.
        
    - **MakerDAO**: stablecoin collateral and governance.
        
    - **Aave/Compound**: lending and borrowing.
        
    - **L2 ecosystems**: how scaling (Arbitrum, Optimism) is shaping DeFi.
        
    
5. **Challenges & Risks**
    
    - Smart contract risk, hacks, and exploits.
        
    - Regulatory uncertainty.
        
    - User experience (still too complex for mainstream).
        
    
6. **Framework for Evaluation**
    
    Similar to your “evaluation framework” in the last post. Possible criteria:
    
    - Decentralization (governance, control, custody).
        
    - Transparency (audits, on-chain data).
        
    - Composability (how easily it plugs into the DeFi ecosystem).
        
    - Sustainability (tokenomics, incentives).
        
    - Regulatory resilience.
        
    
7. **Conclusion**
    
    - DeFi is still early — like social media before Facebook, it’s fragmented and experimental.
        
    - But it has the potential to reshape finance in the same way onchain social is reshaping communication.
