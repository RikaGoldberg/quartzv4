## DeFi is More than Speculation

DeFi has plenty of tropes: crypto bros timing the market, chasing jackpots, flexing wins (and downplaying losses). But trading to make a quick buck is hollow.

To be fair, some of these tropes are true.

Most people’s first touchpoint with crypto is speculation — buying a token on an exchange like Coinbase, driven by FOMO and the hope of making quick money. Personally, I think that’s problematic. Trading is short-term and risky; investing is long-term and purposeful.

My own experience with DeFi looks different. I work in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a new type of organization.

I am paid on-chain in a combination of stablecoins (e.g, USDC) and protocol native tokens (e.g, UNI, ARB), also known as governance tokens. From there, I move assets between wallets the way others move dollars between checking and savings. My DeFi experience is grounded in real-life financial flows, not speculation.

DeFi isn’t just a casino. It’s the rails of a new financial economy — open to traders, investors, builders, business folks, and really anyone curious enough to explore.

## Useful Definitions

What is **Decentralized Finance** (DeFi)?

- DeFi is a new type of finance that removes the intermediaries we rely on in traditional, centralized systems. Transactions are peer-to-peer, fast, and markets are open 24/7.
    

What is **Traditional Finance** (TradFi)?

- TradFi refers to the legacy financial system built around banks, brokers, and other intermediaries. In TradFi, access to money and markets depends on these middlemen — whether it’s opening a checking account, applying for a loan, or trading stocks.
    

What is **Trading?**

- Trading is the buying and selling of assets with a short-term focus, aiming to profit from price swings. In crypto, this often means moving quickly between tokens — trying to “time the market” or capture volatility.
    

What is **Investing?**

- Investing is the act of allocating money or assets with the expectation of long-term growth or income. In crypto, this usually means holding tokens, participating in governance, or providing liquidity with the belief that the protocol or ecosystem will increase in value over time.
    

What is **Permissionlessness?**

- Permissionlessness means anyone can access and use a system without needing approval from a central authority. In DeFi, this is one of the defining features: you don’t need a bank, broker, or government agency to grant you access. All you need is an internet connection and a crypto wallet.
    

What is a **Governance Token?**

- A governance token gives its holders the right to participate in the decision-making of a protocol. Instead of control resting with a company or board of directors, governance tokens distribute voting power to the community.
    

What is a **Pump-and-Dump?**

- A pump-and-dump is a market manipulation scheme where the price of a token is artificially inflated (“pumped”) through hype, misinformation, or coordinated buying. Once the price spikes, early movers sell off their holdings (“dump”), leaving latecomers holding the bag as the price crashes.

## The Origins of DeFi

At the core of DeFi is permissionlessness, which means that anyone anywhere has access to the system There is no need to ask for permission from an authority.

One of the first breakthrough DeFi protocols started with MakerDAO (now known as Sky) in 2017, when it launched the stablecoin DAI.  Instead of relying on a central issuer like a bank, DAI was backed by collateral locked in Ethereum smart contracts. It showed that a community could mint a stable, dollar-pegged asset without a centralized authority in control.

Then in 2018 came Uniswap, which introduced the automated market market (AMM) to swap one token for another. Rather than order books and market makers, used by centralized exchanges, anyone could deposit tokens into a liquidity pool, with an algorithm setting the price.

Around the same time emerged Compound, a protocol for decentralized borrowing and lending. Instead of a bank deciding who qualifies for a loan, Compound allows anyone with collateral to borrow from a shared liquidity pool, with interest rates determined algorithmically.

## DeFi Summer

The summer of 2020 marked an explosion of DeFi experimentation on Ethereum.

At the center of it was a new mechanic: yield farming. Protocols began distributing their governance tokens to users who supplied liquidity. Suddenly, providing capital to DeFi platforms didn’t just earn interest — it came with bonus tokens that could increase in value.

Compound kicked it off by distributing COMP tokens to its lenders and borrowers. Soon after, protocols like Curve, Yearn, and the infamous SushiSwap piled in, each offering outsized rewards to attract liquidity. Billions of dollars in assets flooded into DeFi protocols within weeks.

The gold rush however had downsides. Many token incentives were unsustainable, leading to “pump-and-dump” cycles. Meme-inspired projects went from launch to collapse in days. Hacks and rug pulls became common as unaudited contracts rushed to market.

Despite the chaos, DeFi Summer cemented that DeFi was not just a passing fad. Core protocols like Uniswap, Compound, MakerDAO (now known as Sky), and Aave, emerged stronger, battle-tested by the flood of users and capital.

## Core DeFi Protocols

I’ve already mentioned some of the core DeFi protocols: Uniswap, Compound, MakerDAO, and Aave. But they’re far from the only ones. In the five years since DeFi Summer, the ecosystem has expanded dramatically, with new protocols tackling everything from derivatives to perpetuals to cross-chain liquidity.

With that experimentation comes added risk. For beginners, only a handful of protocols are reliable starting points. That said, I don’t want to suppress curiosity —as I noted in the introduction, DeFi ultimately rewards the curious.

## Beginner Friendly DeFi Building Blocks

For those just getting started, here are a few DeFi protocols that are widely used, battle-tested, and relatively beginner-friendly:

- [**Uniswap**](https://app.uniswap.org/)**:** The go-to decentralized exchange for swapping tokens.
    
- [**Aave**](https://aave.com/)**:** A leading platform for earning interest or borrowing against crypto.
    
- [**Sky (formerly MakerDAO)**](https://makerdao.com/en/)**:** Creator of DAI, a leading decentralized stablecoin.
    
- [**Compound**](https://compound.finance/)**:** A foundational protocol for earning interest or borrowing against crypto, with a strong track record.
    
- [**USDC**](https://www.usdc.com/)**:** A centralized but highly liquid dollar-backed stablecoin, often the on-ramp into DeFi.
    
- [**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io/)**:** A scaling network for Ethereum that makes transactions faster and cheaper, making DeFi more accessible to everyday users.

## Evaluation Framework

As in my previous posts, I’ve put together a simple framework to help you think about how to evaluate DeFi protocols and applications.

1. **Security & Audits**
    
    - Has the protocol undergone third-party audits?
        
    - How long has it been live without major exploits?
        
    - Is the code open-source and battle-tested?
        
2. **Decentralization**
    
    - Who controls upgrades and governance?
        
    - Is voting distributed among many token holders, or concentrated in a few wallets?
        
    - Does the team have a track record of respecting community decisions?
        
3. **Transparency**
    
    - Are reserves, collateral, or liquidity visible onchain?
        
    - Can you easily verify where yield is coming from?
        
4. **Composability**
    
    - Does the protocol integrate with others (e.g., can you use assets from one platform on another)?
        
    - Is it part of the broader DeFi “money Lego” stack, or isolated?
        
5. **Sustainability of Incentives**
    
    - Are yields coming from actual economic activity (fees, borrowing demand), or just inflationary token rewards?
        
    - Will the model work without constant subsidies?
        
6. **User Experience**
    
    - Is the app intuitive?
        
    - Are transaction costs reasonable?
        
    - Is there good documentation and community support?

## Conclusion

Some of DeFi's tropes — crypto bros chasing huge returns, flexing wins, and quietly downplaying losses — will probably always be true. Surprising as it sounds, speculation can play an important role in keeping financial markets healthy.

They key however for most normal folks who don't want to take on excessive risk is that you don't need to be a risk chasing crypto bro to build wealth in this new financial economy. You just need to have an appetite for curiosity, thoughtfulness, and patience. Prioritize education and prudence above all else.

Practically, this might mean starting small with a swap on Uniswap, experimenting with a stablecoin like USDC or DAI, or lending on Aave. For others, it might mean contributing to a DAO or exploring new protocols.

Wherever you begin, the key is curiosity and a willingness to learn.
