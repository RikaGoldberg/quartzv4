### Summary

The article discusses the concept of the "extremist's gambit," a strategy employed by radical groups or individuals when they believe time is not on their side and they want to force a fearful or apathetic majority to see things their way. The strategy involves taking actions to provoke a crisis, making it a binary choice for people to pick a side, effectively eliminating middle ground in a political dispute. While not specific to any one group, the article suggests that this strategy may explain the actions of organizations like Hamas in certain circumstances.
