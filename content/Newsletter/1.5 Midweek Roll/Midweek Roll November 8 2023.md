Gm readers,

Happy Wednesday. It's the middle of the week, which means it's time for the Midweek Roll. In this post, you'll find three curated pieces of content. These are articles that I've read during the week about culture and geopolitics. They are exceptionally thoughtful and I can't stop thinking about them.

Enjoy.

**About the Author:**

[Tanner Greer](https://scholars-stage.org/about-the-author/) is an essayist, journalist, and independent researcher. He is also the director of the Center for Strategic Translation.

**Article Summary:**

The article discusses the concept of the "extremist's gambit," a strategy employed by radical groups or individuals when they believe time is not on their side and they want to force a fearful or apathetic majority to see things their way. The strategy involves taking actions to provoke a crisis, making it a binary choice for people to pick a side, effectively eliminating middle ground in a political dispute. While not specific to any one group, the article suggests that this strategy may explain the actions of organizations like Hamas in certain circumstances.
