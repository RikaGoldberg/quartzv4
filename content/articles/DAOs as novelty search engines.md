### Highlights
Like a toddler taking its first steps, the DAOs of today are immature, unsteady and likely to stumble.

DAOs are novelty search engines which can more efficiently explore a search space by enabling many cooperating teams to collect and integrate stepping stones.

Imagine yourself at the shore of a lake

Stanley & Lehman (2015) draw this analogy in relation to discovery. The lake represents the abstract space of all possibilities, and the stepping stones represent strategies for navigation.

Your journey is a process of searching through the space of all possibilities. The question is, how do you navigate when you don’t know the #nature of the territory?

We can reframe this by thinking of the space of all possibilities as a room. Now imagine yourself an artist, searching through the room to discover the next Monet. Conceived as a search space, we see that this rare diamond is already there. Your purpose is merely to find it among the plethora of meaningless dead-ends

We can think of all complex domains in this way. We know there are new discoveries to be made, if only we knew how to get there. Unfortunately, we can rarely see beyond the most immediate stepping stones.

Consider vacuum tubes. It was obvious to nobody that they would enable the first computers. This only became clear after vacuum tubes and associated computing discoveries had been made, so that someone could make the connecti

We are biased to believe that the interim steps resemble the final goal, and use objectives to reach stepping stones that appear to lead to the final destination. However, without knowing the #nature of the territory, those objectives may well lead us to get stuck.

Consider education. We measure improvement in education based on test scores, on the assumption that better test scores mean we’re getting smarter. “But the Math scores are up! That’s good, right?” Wrong. Optimising for Math scores through assessment forces us to invest in things which improve short term scores, while preventing the exploration of the larger search space

So what’s the alternative? Well, novelty search is a form of non-objective search. Instead of following the stepping stones that appear to lead to the objective, simply collect stepping stones that lead in interesting directions. Focus on newness, regardless of where it leads

The more stepping stones you collect, the more interesting combinations you can create. You can’t predict where they’ll take you, but keep doing it, and you can predict you’ll end up somewhere interesting.

The strength of the hierarchical model is the ability to pursue singular visions arising from a leader, by aligning the work of many individuals towards a convergent outcome. To do so, companies must carefully define the problem they want to solve and maintain a strong focus by measuring their progress against interstitial objectives. However, this prevents companies from exploring the adjacent possible via stepping stones that do not resemble their objective. In turn, it causes them to lose out on their combinatorial possibilities.

Networks have a flexible topology that can re-organise in response to change, adopting new shapes that evolve over time.

Leadership is distributed contextually and individuals are empowered to make decisions that meaningfully change the structure of the organisation, without requiring permission or consensus. We can call this ability self-organisation.

Similarly, in a mature DAO, individuals will be able to understand a part of the network (local context), but they will not be able to appreciate it as a whole (global context). Individuals will interpret the DAO in their own way, and explore directions that affect their local context without having to consider the context of the whole. As they make decisions, the structure of the network will self-organise in response.

Through this mechanism, networks have an information advantage. Individuals know more about themselves than anyone else, and decide for themselves how they are best able to contribute.

…hierarchical organization is a lossy medium.

Peer production has an advantage over firms and markets because it allows larger groups of individuals to scour larger groups of resources in search of materials, projects, collaborations, and combinations…

Tokens, meanwhile, create a mechanism for “weak alignment“, in which everyone in the network has a shared incentive to increase its value. However, the way in which that value is achieved is open to interpretation

The consequence is that DAOs are not suited to pursuing one vision. They are optimised for exploring many divergent visions simultaneously, emerging from individuals making decisions based on their local context. This is a feature (not a bug), and will be the source of strength for the networks to come.

This is an uncomfortable thought for some. “There’s nobody steering the ship!”. “There’s no roadmap!”. No - and that’s the point. They are autonomous. Autonomy derives not just from smart contract logic, but from a continuous process of distributed self-organisation.

Leaders with differing ideas naturally surface in groups of people, and it is equally natural for people to follow leaders and causes they believe in. Rather than replacing hierarchies, DAOs create a mechanism through which a single organisation can allow many hierarchical teams to explore different directions simultaneously.

Problems tend to arise in hierarchies due to groupthink: a progressive inability to consider alternative points of view.

DAOs of the future will benefit from the best of both worlds. Strong, unified hierarchies to achieve convergent outcomes in a local context, exploring many divergent directions while cooperating with one another to improve the state of the whole.

As we identified, objectives aren’t much use when we don’t know the #nature of the territory. Instead, we should collect stepping stones that lead in interesting directions, without knowing exactly where we’ll end up.

The magic of DAOs is to embrace complexity by enabling many cooperating teams to collect divergent stepping stones. Those stepping stones can be shared, reused and combined in new contexts, leading in new directions.

A generating system… is a kit of parts, with rules about the way these parts may be combined. Almost every ‘system as a whole’ is generated by a ‘generating system’. If we wish to make things which function as ‘wholes’ we shall have to invent generating systems to create them.

And so we arrive at the crux of the argument. DAOs are novelty search engines which can more efficiently explore a search space by enabling many cooperating teams to collect and integrate stepping stones.

This capability suggests a unique and interesting role in the future of innovation. Where we end up is unpredictable, but predictably interesting.
