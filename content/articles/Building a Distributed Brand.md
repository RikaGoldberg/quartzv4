## Highlights
A brand embodies the organization's values, contributing to the creation of a shared sense of community among distributed contributors. To define a brand for the Xalgorithms Foundation, I had to understand the distinct challenges and opportunities specific to a decentralized context.

A headless brand strategy is an ecosystemic affair and entails the mobilization of a decentralized set of actors. At its core, it revolves around giving agency to different stakeholders in a way that lets them coordinate more effectively and feel connected to the brand.

Given the open-source nature of the organization, the collaborative journey spans a person's first encounters on social media, all the way through to engaging with activities within the project management structure.

In this context, the organizations identity is contingent upon the action of the contributors. It is not a set of guidelines that mandate the form of deliverable. Rather it is a set of building blocks that people use to organically define the culture of the organization.
