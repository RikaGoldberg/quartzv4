## Highlights
Some might say that Web3 is young, and these issues will simply work themselves out over time. But questions about impacts and externalities were left too late in the design of Web2, with consequences ranging from election manipulation to widespread vaccine misinformation. Some indicators show that early design choices in Web3 are replicating or compounding the inequalities of Web2 and the real world.

**The difference principle says that any social or economic inequalities that do exist in society should meet two conditions. First, they must be “attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality and opportunity.” Social positions, such as jobs, should be open to everyone and allocated by merit.** **In other words, a person’s prospects for success should reflect their level of talent and willingness to use it, not their social class or background. And second, any inequality that does exist should maximize the benefit of the least well off. This is a profound principle. Thus, it’s acceptable that doctors earn more than janitors, because that compensation differential incentivizes doctors to pursue their careers and ensures that janitors (and everyone else) will receive quality care if they fall ill.**

**Rawls’s theory** is nuanced, but in short, it’s unique in how it resolves the central tension between the competing demands of freedom and equality. By requiring that inequalities benefit the least advantaged, Rawls builds in a natural corrective to the rampant inequality that would otherwise emerge in a system that privileges freedom above all else.

This balance between freedom and equality makes Rawls’s theory compelling as a philosophical framework for the internet. **It leaves space for builders to be rewarded for their contributions, which is necessary to foster incentives for smart, ambitious people to build in the ecosystem. At the same time, it places a burden on those builders — and the ecosystem as a whole — to build in a way that creates opportunity for less-advantaged participants.**

But you don’t have to look far for evidence that the Web2 internet falls short of the mark in other ways. Consider just a few examples of how Web2 platforms have inhibited equality and violate the difference principle: **Gig economy platforms bring in billions of dollars in revenue, while the frontline workers who deliver their services earn poverty wages and are shut out of decisions that impact their lives.**

As a first step in aligning Web3’s future with Rawls’s principles of justice, **participants and builders of the Web3 ecosystem need to push for democratic systems of governance that give a voice to all its members, not just a select few. Everyone should be equally enfranchised in the systems in which they participate.**

**There are additional systems of governance that can combat plutocracy,** such as:

**Reputation-based governance**: according greater governance power to those with higher reputational value

**Delegation:** enabling community members to nominate others to vote on their behalf

**Pods/subDAOs: smaller groups within an organization whose scope of governance can be constrained to their missions**
