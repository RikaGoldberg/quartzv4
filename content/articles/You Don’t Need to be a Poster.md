### Highlights
Focusing on the internal satisfaction of creation rather than the external validation of being a poster is a fight. The posters are trying to convince you that external satisfaction is important. They are focused on getting your attention and will likely win some of the time, but you are ultimately in control. You can create processes that shift your mind away from becoming a poster and towards being a creator seeking meaning and insight. You can find people dedicated to a more sustainable path, and choose that path yourself.

Many people spend their time online trying to get as much attention as possible; I refer to them as “posters.” Becoming a poster and making a living doing it (like an influencer or content creator) has become the new American dream. However, this doesn’t mean it’s good or that you have to follow this approach; there are alternatives you can learn.
