-   **(Phase 1) Random**: The system is unstructured. Random events occur without particularly changing the structure.
    
-   **(Phase 2) Growth**: An innovation causes a major phase transition within the structure of the system. The innovation catalyzes other innovations in a positive feedback loop.
    
-   **(Phase 3) Consolidation**: Growth rates saturate. The ecosystem consolidates into a highly organized network, optimized for efficiency, as each [agent](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/agent/) seeks to eke out as much as it can from its position in the value chain. Hubs (keystone species) appear at critical points.
    
-   **(Phase 4) Collapse**: A random shock, or new innovation demolishes one of the keystone species, causing cascade failure within the highly structured network. The ecosystem collapses into a random structure.
    
-   **(Repeat)**: The system begins a slow crawl back up the evolutionary ladder of complexity.

Any evolving network experiences catastrophe and then rebirth. Everything from industries to ecosystems.
