### Highlights
Without art, I would struggle to take stock of the evolution of the knowledge, lessons, and emotional faculties I have managed to accrue and hone over the years—my inner self.

Not only do books, movies, songs, plays, poems, and essays allow me to get a sense of where and who I am, they also allow me to get a sense of where and who I’ve been. Every time I read, watch, or listen to quality art for the second, third, or tenth time, it seems to change. And if perception is the product of object and observation, a change in perception implies a change in observer—an evolution of self.

Accumulating experience is the precursor for personal evolution, but is not personal evolution itself. Experience serves as the basis for reflection. The highest-quality art then serves as the highest-resolution mirrors—providing the reflections upon which real transformation might occur.

Watching _Good Will Hunting_ this weekend allow me to internalize many of the lessons I have (inadvertently) managed to accumulate over the past several years. Furthermore, watching it every year on my birthday will allow me to document my personal evolution from year to year. My reactions, thoughts, takeaways, and reflections each time I watch _Good Will Hunting_ will serve as still-frames of my current emotional, intellectual, and spiritual self.

I hope to genuinely be amused by the prior year’s version of myself each time another birthday rolls around. Anything short of that would be a failure, for as a good friend likes to remind me often—if you’re not embarrassed by the version of yourself from a year ago, you’re not moving fast enough.

As with most things, this is easier said than done. I know I will never be polished if I am irritated by every rub, yet I often find myself frustrated by trivial matters. I know smooth seas never made a good sailor, yet I often find myself straying towards calmer waters—the path of least resistance. Each shortcoming is not only a reminder that I still have much to learn, but also a valuable opportunity to do so.

I hope to continue to accumulate experience, not because there is anything inherently valiant in doing so, but because doing so is the only chance I have to truly grow. It is the only chance I have to shed my layers of mediocrity, in hopes of revealing slightly more sophisticated and slightly less mediocre layers of myself. I hope to repeat this process over and over, and to one day look back and see it as the journey (or the dance) that is and has been my life.
