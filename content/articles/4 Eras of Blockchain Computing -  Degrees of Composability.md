### Highlights
We call this composability. A platform is composable if its existing resources can be used as building blocks and programmed into higher order applications. Composability is important because it allows developers to do more with less, which in turn, can lead to more rapid and compounding innovation.


At a16z crypto, we’ve talked a lot about how crypto networks are analogous to cities in that both cities and crypto networks benefit from bottom-up growth on top of shared infrastructure.
