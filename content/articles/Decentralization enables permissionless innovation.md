## Highlights
Catastrophes in nature look like normal accidents. Because the time scale is very long: millions of years. 

An ecology includes millions of years of evolutionary learning. The learnings are layered into relationships of an ecology. 

Properties of nature: 

decentralization, redundancy, diversity, adaptability = resilience

Machines optimize for a steady state without errors, with lots of efficiency, whereas nature optimizes for change.

Recentralization is inevitable in nature, too.
