### Highlights
Design for emergence prioritizes open-ended combinatorial possibilities such that the design object can be composed and adapted to a wide variety of contextual and idiosyncratic niches by its end-user.

**For example, the quality of ‘wetness’ cannot be found in a single water molecule, but instead arises from the interaction of many water molecules together. In living systems, emergence is at the core of adaptive evolution.**

LEGO offers an example — a simple set of blocks with a shared protocol for connecting to one another from which a nearly infinite array of forms can emerge.

1. THE DESIGNER CAN BE MEANINGFULLY SURPRISED BY WHAT THE END-USER CREATES WITH THEIR TOOL.

Design for emergence is open-ended.

Design for emergence is permissionless

In contrast to user-centered design, design for emergence invites the user into the design process not only as a subject of study, but as a collaborator with agency and control.

For this reason, design for emergence often looks like a ‘kit of parts,’ with ease of use operating largely as a function of the number of parts and the number of ways they can be joined together.

HyperCard could be easily adapted to unanticipated purposes. Children used it to create and organize databases of game cards. Academic researchers used it in psychological studies. Restaurateurs used it to report orders coming through registers. HyperCard was even used to control the lights on two of the world’s tallest buildings, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
