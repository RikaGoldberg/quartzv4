**ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN CHANGE, from the perspective of many psychoanalysts, is to recognize your patterns of thought and behavior, to make the unconscious conscious. That way you can pause in the moment rather than act on autopilot, take in the information before you, check in with yourself, and decide how you want to behave. The ability to make conscious choices is the crucial freedom that psychoanalysis can offer.**

I see. She nodded, then turned to my soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend who was half listening, because he only ever half listened to anyone.

You keep using that word, she said to him, then paused longer than was comfortable. What’s wrong with you? Have you stopped feeling

We were breaking up, although that didn’t become clear until an extremely drunk woman stumbled over to our table and asked, What does arbitrary mean?

**Psychoanalysis posits a continually evolving self**: we are each “[a] poem that is being written,” as psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan has it, "even if it looks like a subject," even if the living text of our unconscious is inscribed in an indecipherable code. **To take responsibility for who we become, for the poem that gets written, we must understand our unconscious. Deciphering the unconscious is what makes it possible for us to become the one we are and, from that position, direct our choices.** “The analyst,” writes psychoanalyst W.R. Bion, “is trying to help the patient to dare to be himself, to dare to have enough respect for his personality to be that person."

**A metaphor condenses two things in such a way that a similarity is brought into relief—for example, the world and a stage, as in William Shakespeare’s line “All the world’s a stage”—while a metonym displaces one term with another that is different but associated.**

I LEARNED THE DEFINITION OF METONYM in graduate school. The professor wrote on the blackboard: All night long. He then asked, What is associated with the night? Someone called out, The moon! The professor then added a second sentence: All the moon long. The moon, he explained, was an association with night that then displaced it. You can build a chain of metonymic associations, he continued, with each new word linking to and displacing the last: **All night long. All the moon long. All the stars long.**

OUR MINDS ENLIST VARIOUS MANEUVERS that allow us to keep our hands moving across the keyboard, to remain composed, regardless of our emotional state. As we become better able to clear our histories, act through avatars, and tweak our profiles, we live in the fantasy that we are expunging the unconscious, deleting it, seizing the blank moment with a cleared past, tabula rasa. Bookmarked tabs are the personal myth we prepare for an imagined Other—not necessarily the sites most visited, but the ones we identify with ourselves, the outwardly directed persona we would tolerate another person apprehending if they were to catch a glimpse of our screen.

**Focusing on the surface, lining up your external chips, often results in immediate social reward, yet it can also cause you to lose sight of your interior. In extreme cases, the surface may even become the interior, like the map that comes to stand in for the territory, as philosopher Jean Baudrillard describes it: a simulation that takes the place of the real. The virtual can even feel more real than the real, as happened to a couple in Korea who left their infant daughter at home while they camped out in an internet café playing a video game in which they successfully raised a virtual child. Their daughter starved to death**.

When a person becomes a simulation—when it is difficult to distinguish between their self and their role in the game—they may be said, in psychoanalytic terms, to have an “as-­if” personality. An as-­if person, according to psychoanalyst Helen Deutsch, who coined the term, appears “intellectually intact,” able to create a “repetition of a prototype [but] without the slightest trace of originality” because “expressions of emotion are formal. all inner experience is completely excluded.” **She likens the behavior of someone with an as-­if personality to “the performance of an actor who is technically well trained but who lacks the necessary spark to make his impersonations true to life”**

**Anyone who has lost contact with their True Self—their inner world—and merely repeats a prototype that has been internalized from outside, a False Self, will also lack that true-­to-­life spark—Winnicott’s “creative originality”— and lose the ability to seem or feel real.**

Trump focuses on what is already in his mind over what he might perceive were he to listen fully—keeping his internal projector on high, his external on standby—until all the world is a simulation supplanting the real and, like Mr. Arbitrary, he loses the ability to feel.

**Aggression, likewise, when released in the “correct” way—in the form of a joke, for example—can function like a fire and help maintain the social ecosystem, harness the destructive aliveness of individuals, and channel the burning energy in a positive direction. Humor that expresses healthy forms of aggression can protect against the wilder kinds.**

When someone laughs spontaneously at a joke, it is a sign that the latent part of the joke—the kernel of thought—has resonated with something in their unconscious. **Chappelle found himself in a “complete moral dilemma.”** If he couldn’t control whether the audience took his use of stereotypes ironically or literally, he also couldn’t control whether he was subverting stereotypes or reinforcing them.

IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR HEADS INTACT, most of us, rather than flee, exile our unthinkable thoughts. We sometimes strive to unsee what we see, unknown what we know, because anything that destabilizes our psychic equilibrium can get in the way of our ability to perform the daily tasks that are expected of us. Taking in information that runs counter to our beliefs presses us to adapt our perspective, whereas perverse thinking allows us to maintain our beliefs by disavowing what is before us if it feels too unsettling. **It can be destabilizing to change long­standing ideas about ourselves, others, and the world, which is why, even as evidence contradicting a belief should lead us to adjust the belief to accommodate reality, many people will bend the evidence before them to keep their thinking the same.**

**It is always easier to change a person who doesn’t fit our expectations than to change a stereotype.** When faced with me, evidence in the world that contradicted her thinking, instead of changing her thinking, my neighbor changed me (You’re different).

IF WE DON’T ALLOW PERCEPTIONS from the external world to reach the translucent screen of consciousness—either by turning our external projector to standby or half-listening—we not only feel less real but also risk diminishing the reality of others in ways that can quickly slip from insensitive to dehumanizing to annihilating.

**We are our choices, as philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre says: “an individual chooses and makes himself.” Our choices determine our identity. If we choose to act courageously, we become courageous. But the moment we make a different choice—say, to act callously—we become that next thing. We are always becoming the self our most recent choice calls into being, the poem that gets written. And existences, like poems, are most powerful when fueled by the True Self, that necessary spark.**

“Oh God!” Winnicott writes in “Prayer.” “May I be alive when I die!”
