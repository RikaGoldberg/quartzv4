### Highlights
So instead, consumer applications in crypto/Web3 are independently built on top of multiple “composable” protocols using what we could call a cryptoservices architecture (like microservices, but with sovereign components). 

In Decentralized Finance (DeFi) people call this “money legos”. Consider Zerion (a Placeholder investment), Instadapp and Multis. They are building similar crypto-finance apps using many of the same protocols, like Ethereum, Compound, Maker, and Uniswap.

This allows them to deliver a complete suite of financial services (transactions, borrowing, lending, trading, investing, etc.) without building all that functionality, infrastructure and liquidity in-house.

The protocols provide specific services across many interfaces and the apps on top share resources and data with no centralized platform risk. Sharing the infrastructure lowers the costs across the board. These same dynamics are showing up in corners of crypto like DAOs and games. 

A cryptoservices architecture is great for startups. Entrepreneurs can launch new applications quickly and cheaply by outsourcing a lot of the functionality to various networks. And every app is on equal footing when it comes to protocol costs and resources (unlike web infrastructure like AWS where the smaller you are, the more expensive it is). The companies above stand out because they brought fully-featured products to the market before their first real rounds of funding. They’re a first look at the level of capital efficiency that’s possible for “thin” applications using this new model, compared to the increasing amount of capital web companies need to raise to compete with incumbents. 

s. But resource-constrained startups have to look for other models to compete.

And the increasing costs of security and new regulation turns data into a liability. This works to the advantage of companies that can afford these costs.

As a crypto user, you bring your own data. Nobody has monopoly control. When you log into a crypto app by connecting your wallet, you’re sharing the “keys” it needs to find your information across the relevant networks. You can share them with any app, so your data comes with you as you move from interface to interface. And you keep control of the “private key” (basically a password) needed to operate on it, like signing messages or authorizing transactions. So you have effective custody over your data and nobody can manipulate it without consent (unless you delegated your keys to a custodian). 

A cryptoservices architecture combined with a non-custodial data model allows startups to compete more effectively against centralized incumbents

Giving ownership and control to the users offloads a lot of costs while fulfilling many of today’s consumer demands. It does require companies to give up a lot of what makes traditional online services defensible.

But what you lose in control, you gain in potential efficiency and scale. Adopting these models allows businesses to run at very low costs, and applications benefit from each other’s success because they contribute to a shared pool of resources at the protocol level.

So we can estimate a market’s value structure by studying its cost structure. In crypto, the networks at the protocol layer bear most of the costs of production so they require more investment – which means more of the value has to accrue to that layer to maintain equilibrium (or the investment doesn’t happen). Applications cost less to operate and require less investment, so they naturally demand less of the market’s value.

At first glance, they look similar to the loyalty/reward systems used to retain customers in other hyper-commoditized markets like airlines and credit cards. Except those programs provide no upside at all. The innovation is in designing token models that allow users to profit from the application’s growth. It goes beyond marginal benefits like discounts by including users in the upside of the business.

But what I love about their staking models is how they change the user-service relationship. Web users are locked-in by force through the centralization of data. Crypto applications, even if they’re built more traditionally, don’t have that same ability to lock you in. But user-staking creates a kind of “opt-in” economic lock-in that benefits the user by turning them into stakeholders in the success of the service. It creates defensibility through user-ownership instead of user lock-in. This presents a universe of fascinating consequences, to be explored in future work.
