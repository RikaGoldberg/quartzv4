## Quotes
>So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science, has a lot to say about that. You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm. You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one. **You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power**. You donâ€™t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.
