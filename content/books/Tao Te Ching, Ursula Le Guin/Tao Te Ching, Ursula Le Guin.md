## Summary: 
A book of poems from 2,500 years ago that feels like a [religious](/notes/religion.md) text, but it's not. 

The book is about The Way, a nebulous path that one follows by acting in a certain way. Common themes are acting with gentleness and kindness; being simple; being a quiet leader; doing without doing.

## Quotes
### Consider Beginnings
**Do without doing. Act without action. Treat the small as large,**

Savor the flavorless.

the few as many.

Meet injury

with the power of goodness.

**Study the hard while it's easy.**

Do big things while they're small. The hardest jobs in the world start out easy, the great affairs of the world start small.

So the wise soul,

**by never dealing with great things, gets great things done.**

**Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,

and taking things too easy makes them hard, the wise soul**,

**by treating the easy as hard, doesn't find anything hard.**

Waley says that this charmingly complex chapter plays with two proverbs. "Requite injuries with good deeds" is the first. **The word te, here meaning goodness or good deeds, is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the Way.** ("**Power is goodness**," he says in chapter 49.) **So, having neatly annexed the Golden Rule, he goes on to the proverb about "taking things too lightly" and plays paradox with it.**

### ACTING SIMPLY

True leaders are hardly known to their followers.

Next after them are the leaders the people know and admire; after them, those they fear; after them, those they despise.

To give no trust is to get no trust.

When the work's done right, with no fuss or boasting, ordinary people say, Oh, we did it.

_Author’s note: This invisible leader, who gets things done in such a way that people think they did it all themselves, isn't one who manipulates others from behind the scenes; just the opposite. Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force. An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers._

###  BEING QUIET
Brim-fill the bowl, it'll spill over.

Keep sharpening the blade, you'll soon blunt it.

Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade.

Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin.

To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing.

### SECOND BESTS

In the degradation of the great way come benevolence and righteousness.

With the exaltation of learning and prudence comes immense hypocrisy.

The disordered family is full of dutiful children and parents.

The disordered society is full of loyal patriots.
