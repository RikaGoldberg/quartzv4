## Highlights
It doesn’t take much effort to state what you want to be, where you want to go, or what you want to accomplish. The problem is getting there. **More specifically, the problem is that it’s hard to identify the stepping stones between here and the objective.**

This insight suggests a strange idea: Perhaps the effort invested in specifying clear objectives would be sometimes better spent in i**dentifying promising stepping stones, but not specifically those leading to the objective.** After all, the objective offers few clues to what its stepping stones should be. So maybe there’s a different way to think about **search.** **Instead of worrying about where we want to be, we could compare where we are now to where we have been.** **If we find ourselves somewhere genuinely novel, then this novel discovery may later prove a stepping stone to new frontiers**. While we may not know what those frontiers are, the present stepping stone becomes the gateway to finding out.

**What good then is it to compare the present with the idealized future? Let’s instead try something different and more principled. We can instead compare to the past, which is a lot easier than the future because we know it—the past already happened.**

The past doesn’t tell us about the objective but it does offer a clue to something equally if not more important—**the past is a guide to novelty**. **But unlike the future, there’s no ambiguity and no deception because we actually know where we were in the past, so we know how it compares to where we are today. Instead of judging our progress towards a goal, the past allows us to judge our liberation from the outdated.** **Interestingly, the question then changes from what we’re approaching to what we’re escaping. And the exciting thing about escaping the past is that it opens new possibilities.**

The point is that novelty can often act as a stepping stone detector because anything novel is a potential stepping stone to something even more novel. In other words, novelty is a rough shortcut for identifying interestingness: Interesting ideas are those that open up new possibilities.

In the words of the famous philosopher Alfred Whitehead 
“It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true.” W.T. Stace, another philosopher, adds that “the criticism that interestingness is a trivial end
proceeds from a scale of values thus perverted and turned upside down.” **Far from trivial, novel and interesting ideas tend to suggest new ways of thinking that lead to
further novelties.**

In Picbreeder, the Alien Face was not chosen because it might lead to the Car, but because the Alien Face itself was something interesting and novel. It was worth exploring the path opened by the Alien Face because it held potential—not the kind of objective potential measured by an intelligence test or performance assessment—
but the potential that hangs in the sunset viewed over an endless sea, the transcendent possibility of an open future. **Let’s try to capture that kind of potential in a bottle. The key to it will be chasing novelty.**

It’s natural to fear that hunting for novelty might not lead to anything meaningful.
**One of the main reasons for this kind of doubt has to do with information. The
fear is that the only useful information for guiding search is the kind obtained
through considering what you hope to find.** But the truth is that novelty is no less
information-rich than the concept of the objective. **It’s just different information. In
fact, the argument can be made that the information driving the concept of novelty
is actually more plentiful and reliable than that provided by the objective, especially
when you consider that the objective is often a false compass**. **Rather than relying
on a false compass, novelty only asks us to compare where we are with where we’ve
been.**

This insight connects to another common myth about achievement. This myth of
serendipity is that serendipity is an accident. The classic stereotype for serendipitous
discovery is the mad scientist stumbling clumsily into some profound breakthrough.
It brings to mind a cartoonish character accidentally exploding a bottle of peanut
butter in a microwave oven only to discover the secret to anti-gravity. But this kind
of caricature undeservedly gives serendipity a bad name because it’s so rarely a
bumbling accident.

To investigate how promising it is to search without objectives,
we’ll design a kind of computer program, or algorithm, that has no objective.

**Eventually doing something genuinely novel always requires learning something about the world. You can’t invent a new dance without first knowing how to walk, and you can’t walk without some understanding (at least subconscious) of gravity and motion.**

While **divergence** abandons the comfort of probing only in one predetermined
direction, it is no coincidence that the term divergent thinking is associated with
creativity and innovation. **It is for the very reason that divergent thinkers do not
become trapped in a stale corner of the search space that they are known for
fearless and surprising discoveries that others tend to miss**. By foregoing explicit
final objectives, **novelty search becomes a form of divergent search, thereby joining
company with natural evolution and human innovation, and aligning it with this
more exotic and radical form of discovery.**
