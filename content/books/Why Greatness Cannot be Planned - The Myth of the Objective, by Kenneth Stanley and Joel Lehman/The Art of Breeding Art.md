### Quotes
The story of this book really began when our research group decided to build a website called Picbreeder that was also a unique kind of scientific experiment. At first, the idea behind Picbreeder had little clear connection to objectives. In fact, it was originally conceived as a place where visitors could literally breed pictures. While that may not make sense when you first hear it, it’s actually a simple idea. The plan was to make it work roughly like animal breeding: Pictures on the site would be able to have “children” that are slightly different from their parents (just as animals have children that are unique but still clearly related to their parents). The hope was that by allowing visitors to breed the pictures they find most interesting, over time they would end up breeding works of art that please them, **even if the visitors themselves were not artists.**

Genetic art programs work in much the same way as breeding horses, except that instead of choosing animals to breed, you choose pictures. What happens is that you see a set of pictures on the screen (perhaps there could be 10 or 20 pictures displayed together at the same time). Then you click on the ones you like, which become the parents of the next generation of pictures. For example, if most of the pictures look circular but you click on the one picture that looks more square, then the next generation will likely contain many square-like images (Fig. 3.1). In other words, square parents make square babies, just as your children might have eyes that look like yours. But like in nature, the offspring don’t look exactly like their parents. There are slight mutations hidden in their genes, though of course you can still see the resemblance.

So what does any of this have to do with objectives? There actually is a connection, though it took some time for us to really appreciate it. The objective comes in when you think about where you hope the breeding will lead—that’s your objective. For example, with horses your objective might be to breed a fast horse. On Picbreeder, you might want to breed a picture of a face, or an animal. What turned out to be really surprising is that Picbreeder visitors almost always bred the best images when those images were not their objective. In other words, Picbreeder seemed to work best when visitors were open minded about what they hoped to find. To see how we can be sure of that, and why it ultimately relates to the impact of objectives in many facets of life, it helps to understand a few details on how the site is set up.

Jimmy Secretan, then a Ph.D. student attending our research group meetings, suggested a clever solution to this problem: Make Picbreeder into an online service. That way, users could share images they had previously evolved with other users, who could then continue breeding them. In other words, if you evolved a triangle on Picbreeder, you could publish it to the website, and then someone else could continue breeding it and perhaps discover an airplane. In Picbreeder, this kind of handoff from one user to another is called branching. The great thing about branching is that it allows breeding to continue far beyond the 20-generation limit. Tired users can continually hand their current product to a fresh new user to add yet another 20 generations to its lineage. Eventually, these linked chains of handoffs can build up to hundreds of generations of evolution.

After all, why should Picbreeder be different than anything else in life? There’s something you want to create or to achieve, so you start working on finding the stepping stones that lead you there. But how can you be sure that the stepping stones actually look anything like your ultimate objective? What if they are instead like the Alien Face, full of potential, but entirely unlike where they ultimately could lead (like the Car)? In that case, if you concentrate too much on achieving your objective, you’ll end up ignoring the most critical steps to reaching it. Could it really be, we wondered, that this principle, first observed on an obscure picture-breeding website, actually impacts every aspect of life concerned with achieving objectives? If it does, then it must be important, because objectives are everywhere. And as you saw from all the examples in the last chapter, the same story seems to emerge in many facets of life. But no matter how many stories we show you with this kind of plot, it still doesn’t fully answer why the world works this way. That’s what the next chapter is about. Yes, abandoning objectives is often the best decision, but there’s a reason for this pattern, which is that the stepping stones almost never resemble the final destination, whether planned or not. In other words, no matter how tempting it is to believe in it, the distant objective cannot guide you to itself—it is the ultimate false compass.
