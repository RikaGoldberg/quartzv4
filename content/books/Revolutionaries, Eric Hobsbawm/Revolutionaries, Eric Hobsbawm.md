** About the Author**

Eric John Ernest Hobsbawm, a self-confessed "unrepentant communist", was professor emeritus of economic and social history of the University of London at Birkbeck. He wrote many acclaimed historical works, including a trilogy on the nineteenth-century: _The Age of Revolution_, _The Age of Capital_, and _The Age of Empire_, and was the author of _The Age of Extremes: The Short 20th Century 1914-1991_ and his recent autobiography, _Interesting Times: A Twentieth-Century Life_.

**Summary**

Ranging from historical investigations into [Marxism](/notes/Marxism.md) and communism to contemporary appraisals of revolutionary movements and meditations on , Hobsbawm’s commentaries are essential guides to ideas and people that changed the face of the twentieth century.

Hobsbawm’s essays retain a freshness that speaks both to his brilliance as a writer and scholar, as well as to the perennial importance of his subjects. At a time when the very concept of revolution has been largely discredited, these essays remind us of the enduring importance of radical investigations into—and solutions to—society’s persistent inequalities and injustices.
