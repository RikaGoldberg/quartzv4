>To free divers, [free diving is the ancient practice of diving hundreds of feet below the water's surface on a single breath of air] breathing wasn't an unconscious act; it wasn't something they just did. It was a force, a mechanism through which they could gain almost a superhuman power. 
>To get a sense of how breathing is regarded by modern medical professionals, think back to your last check-up. Chances are your doctor took your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, then placed a stethoscope to your chest to assess the health of your heart and lungs. But she likely never checked your respiratory rate. She never checked the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your bloodstream.

>The book is a scientific adventure into the lost art and science of breathing. It explores the transformation that occurs inside our bodies every 3.3 seconds, the time it takes the average person to inhale and exhale.
