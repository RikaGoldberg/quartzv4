### TL;DR
Ancient cultures knew the importance of breathing consciously on health and longevity. Some books of the Chinese Tao focused entirely on breathing. Buddhists used breathing to lengthen their lives and access higher states of consciousness. 

Breathing consciously is extremely important to health and longevity.
