#RikaNewsletter 

Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholarships, and the like;

(To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them, except as it results to their bodies and souls, So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked,

And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks

himself or herself, And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full the rotten excrement of maggots,

And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true realities of life, and go toward false realities,

And often to me they are alive after what custom has serve

them, but nothing more, And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk.)
