### Notes
The US waged a war in Afghanistan for close to 19 years. It was full of blunders by people like Donald Rumsfield and Bush, who didn't know who the bad guys were. 

They did not have a clear strategy, no plan. This made the war go on much longer than needed. 

Rumsfield wrote daily memos, he called them snowflakes. His personality was really aggressive and angry. People did not like him. 

## Quotes
### Foreword

Two weeks after the 9/11 attacks, as the United States girded for war Afghanistan, a reporter Defense - Rumsfeld a straightforward question: Would U.S. officials lie to the news media about military operations in order to mislead the enemy?

Rumsfeld stood at the podium in the Pentagon briefing room. The building still smelled of smoke and jet fuel from when American Airlines flight 77 exploded into the west wall, killing 189 people. The defense sec retary started to reply by paraphrasing a quotation from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: "In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies." Rumsfeld explained how the Allies, prior to D-Day, ran a disinformation campaign called Operation Bodyguard to confuse the Germans about when and where the invasion of western Europe would take place in 1944.

Rumsfeld sounded as if he were justifying the practice of spreading lies during wartime, but then he pivoted and insisted he would never do such a thing. "The answer to your question is, no, I cannot imagine a situation," he said. "I don't recall that I've ever lied to the press. I don't. intend to, and it seems to me that there will not be reason for it. There are dozens of ways to avoid having to put yourself in a position where you're lying. And I don't do it."

Asked if the same could be expected of everyone else in the Defense Department, Rumsfeld paused and gave a little smile.

### CHAPTER ONE A Muddled Mission

Marine One, the white-topped presidential helicopter, made a gentle landing on the perfectly clipped grass of the Virginia Military

Institute's Parade Ground around 10 a.m. on April 17, 2002, a hot and

sunny spring morning in the Shenandoah Valley. In Cameron Hall, the

school's basketball arena, about 2,000 cadets were trying not to sweat

in their starched gray-and-white full-dress uniforms as they waited to

welcome the commander in chief. When President George W. Bush

walked onto the stage a few minutes later, winking and waving and

flashing upright thumbs, the audience rose to its feet and gushed with

applause. Bush had reason to smile and bask in the attention. Six months earlier, he had ordered the U.S. military to go to war in Afghanistan to retaliate for the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed 2,977 people in New York City, northern Virginia and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Unlike any other war in American history, this one began suddenly and unexpect edly, provoked by a stateless enemy embedded in a landlocked country on the other side of the globe. But the initial success of the military campaign had surpassed the expectations of even the most optimistic field commanders. Victory appeared in hand.

Relying on a combination of punishing airpower, CIA-backed war lords and commando teams on the ground, the United States and its allies toppled the Taliban-led government in Kabul in less than six

### CHAPTER SIX Islam for Dummies

Is the U.S. military settled into Afghanistan, it mobilized Special A Forces Forces teams to carry out operations to influence the emotions, thinking and behavior of ordinary Afghans and their leaders. Known as psychological operations, or psy-ops, the tactics were a longstanding form of unconventional warfare to shape popular opinion in favor of American objectives and sap the enemy's will to fight. Green Berets and military contractors on psy-op teams studied foreign cultures so they could exploit religious, linguistic and social nuances to their advantage.

But the psy-op specialists and other soldiers who parachuted into Afghanistan were operating in the dark. Years after the war started, the U.S. military still had almost no uniformed personnel who could speak Dari or Pashto fluently. Few troops possessed even a remote grasp of Afghanistan's history, its religious customs or tribal dynamics.

When Maj. Louis Frias, an officer with the 8th PSYOP Battalion from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, deployed to Afghanistan in July 2003, he prepared by reading the paperback Islam For Dummies on the plane ride over. He taught himself a couple phrases in Dari but garbled them so badly that Afghans pleaded with him to stick to English. "I felt like a dork," he said in an Army oral-history interview.

Frias led a small psy-ops team that worked out of the U.S. embassy and distributed radio scripts and posters to build support for demo cratic principles and the Afghan security forces. But the team's biggest

### CHAPTER EIGHT Lies and Spin

The suicide bomber arrived at Bagram Air Base in a Toyota Corolla late in the morning on February 27, 2007. He maneuvered past the Afghan police at the first checkpoint. The bomber continued a quarter mile down the road toward the main gate and approached the second checkpoint, this one staffed by U.S. soldiers. Amid mud puddles and a jumble of pedestrians and vehicle traffic, he triggered his vest of explosives.

The blast killed two Americans and a South Korean assigned to the international military coalition: U.S. Army Private First Class Daniel Zizumbo, a 27-year-old from Chicago with a fondness for lollipops; Staff Sgt. Yoon Jang-Ho, the first South Korean soldier to die in a foreign conflict since Vietnam; and Geraldine Marquez, an American contrac tor for Lockheed Martin who had just celebrated her 31st birthday. The explosion also claimed the lives of twenty Afghan laborers who came to the base that day looking for work.

Unharmed in the explosion was a VIP guest at Bagram who had been trying to keep a low profile-Vice President Dick Cheney.

Cheney had slipped into the war zone the day before on an unan nounced trip to the region. Arriving on Air Force Two from Islamabad, he intended to spend only a few hours in Afghanistan to see President Hamid Karzai. But bad weather prevented him from reaching Kabul so he spent the night at Bagram, about thirty miles from the capital.
