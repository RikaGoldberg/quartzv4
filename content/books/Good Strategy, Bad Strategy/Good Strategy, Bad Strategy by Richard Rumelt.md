A good strategy finds a niche and takes specific actions to drive results in that niche.

A good strategy seeks the next window of opportunity.

Good strategy is built on functional knowledge about what works, what doesn’t, and why. 

Good strategy needs a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.

The most precious functional knowledge is proprietary, available only to your organization.

A new strategy is, in the language of science, a hypothesis, and its implementation is an experiment. As results appear, good leaders learn more about what does and doesn’t work and adjust their strategies accordingly.

They had expected that I would give them a “logical machine” that they could use to deduce business plans—a system for generating forecasts and actions.

If new insights or ideas are not needed, deduction is sufficient. There can be times when results are fine, when no new opportunities seem to have developed and no new risks have appeared. Then, the logical answer to the strategy question is simply “Keep it up, do more of the same.” But in a world of change and flux, “more of the same” is rarely the right answer. In a changing world, a good strategy must have an entrepreneurial component. That is, it must embody some ideas or insights into new combinations of resources for dealing with new risks and opportunities.

The presumption that all important knowledge is already known, or available through consultation with authorities, deadens innovation. It is this presumption that stifles change in traditional societies and blocks improvement in organizations and societies that come to believe that their way is the best way. To generate a strategy, one must put aside the comfort and security of pure deduction and launch into the murkier waters of induction, analogy, judgment, and insight.

After the fall of Rome, inquiry was blocked by the omnipresent assumption that all important knowledge had already been revealed. Intellectual energy was channeled toward faith, art, battle, and self-discipline.

Men searched for first principles in science, politics, and philosophy, purposefully pushing aside the authority of power, faith, and custom

Newton would invent calculus and show that the planets’ orbits about the sun obeyed a natural law more precise and less forgiving than the commands of any cardinal, pope, or king.

A strategy is, like a scientific hypothesis, an educated prediction of how the world works.

Science is a method, not an outcome, and the basic method of good businesspeople is intense attention to data and to what works.

One of the most important resources a business can have is valuable privileged information—that is, knowing something that others do not. There is nothing arcane or illicit about such information—it is generated every day in every operating business. All alert businesspeople can know more about their own customers, their own products, and their own production technology than anyone else in the world. Thus, once Schultz initiated business operations, he began to accumulate privileged information.


Over more time, Schultz discovered that Americans wanted takeout coffee so he introduced paper cups.

Joe Santos’s comments imply that incumbents had difficulty understanding Starbucks because it was vertically integrated—because it roasted, branded, and served its own coffee in its own company restaurants.


Integration is not always a good idea. When a company can buy perfectly good products and services from outside suppliers, it is usually wasteful to go through the expense and trouble of mastering a new set of business operations. However, when the core of a business strategy requires the mutual adjustment of multiple elements, and especially when there is important learning to be captured about interactions across business elements, then it may be vital to own and control these elements of the business mix.

Being strategic is being less myopic—less shortsighted—than others. You must perceive and take into account what others do not, be they colleagues or rivals. Being less myopic is not the same as pretending you can see the future. You must work with the facts on the ground, not the vague outlines of the distant future. Whether it is insight into industry structures and trends, anticipating the actions and reactions of competitors, insight into your own competencies and resources, or stretching your own thinking to cover more of the bases and resist your own biases, being “strategic” largely means being less myopic than your un-deliberative self.

I explain that Blink judgments may work for people situations and certain kinds of pattern matching. Unfortunately, there is also a good deal of research revealing that most people are poor at making many kinds of judgments, whether done in a blink or in a month. Of special concern are judgments about the likelihoods of events, about one’s own competence relative to others’, and about cause-and-effect relationships

In reasoning about natural data, people tend to see patterns where there is only randomness, tend to see causes rather than associations, and tend to ignore information that conflicts with a maintained theory.

Still, why not revisit that judgment and generate alternative views? And, why not then evaluate them in light of one another? Why the overly quick closure on the first?”

The problem is that there might be better ideas out there, just beyond the edge of our vision. But we accept early closure because letting go of a judgment is painful and disconcerting. To search for a new insight, one would have to put aside the comfort of being oriented and once again cast around in choppy waters for a new source of stability. There is the fear of coming up empty-handed. Plus, it is unnatural, even painful, to question our own ideas.

But, you do not have to be a captive to that unconscious dodge. You can choose how you will approach a problem; you can guide your own thinking about it.” I want them to see that this is the heart of the matter. This personal skill is more important than any one so-called strategy concept, tool, matrix, or analytical framework. It is the ability to think about your own thinking, to make judgments about your own judgments.

The kernel is a list reminding us that a good strategy has, at a minimum,
three essential components: a diagnosis of the situation, the choice of an overall guiding policy, and the design of coherent action

Monopolies that use bundling to restrict competition are an old story in antitrust, as illustrated by the cases of IBM, the regional telephone companies, and Microsoft. As long as monopoly cable companies can bundle, it will always be extremely difficult for outside companies to add value to the television experience. This perspective suggests that TiVo spend less on marketing and more on a legal attack on the industry’s structure. In such an attack, it would have many important, and larger, allies.

The panel of experts trick works because we are adept at recognizing and comprehending well-integrated human personalities. Thinking through how a particular well-remembered expert might respond to a problem can be a richer s

My own personal virtual panel of experts contains respected executives I have known and worked with, people who educated and trained me, colleagues I have worked with over the years, and certain people whose points of view emerge clearly from their own written work or from biography. When I face a problem, or have generated a first hunch, I turn to this panel and ask, “What is wrong with this approach to the situation? What would you do in this case?”

Listening to Teece’s and Jobs’s imaginary counsel, I am reminded that good strategies are usually “corner solutions.” That is, they emphasize focus over compromise. They focus on one aspect of the situation, not trying to be all things to all people

Learning from others can be more than simply listening to them, watching them, or reading what they write. When you build your own panel of experts you go one step farther, trying to shape your understanding of their teachings into a virtual personality. When it works, it does so because we humans have built-in software for understanding other humans, software that is more expert at recognizing and recalling personalities than at almost anything else.

Good strategy grows out of an independent and careful assessment of the situation, harnessing individual insight to carefully crafted purpose. Bad strategy follows the crowd, substituting popular slogans for insights.

Being independent without being eccentric and doubting without being a curmudgeon are some of the most difficult things a person can do
