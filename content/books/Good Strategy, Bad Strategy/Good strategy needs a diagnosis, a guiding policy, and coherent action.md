#### Quotes

"A good strategy has coherence, coordinating action, policies and resources so as to accomplish an important end. Many organizations, most of the time, don’t have this.

Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy."

"A good strategy honestly acknowledges the challenges being faced and provides an approach to overcoming them. And the greater the challenge, the more a good strategy focuses and coordinates efforts to achieve a powerful competitive punch or problem-solving effect
