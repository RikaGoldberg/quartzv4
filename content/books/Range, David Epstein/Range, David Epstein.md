*Why generalists triumph in a specialized world*

### Summary
A book with anecdotes about how generalists do well in a world designed by specialists for specialists. 

### Notes
Specialists get molded into doing their expert task from a young age (think Tiger Woods) vs. Roger Federer. 

Generalists are better at thinking outside the box and learning new skills. 

### Quotes INTRODUCTION Roger vs. Tiger

LET'S START WITH a couple of stories from the world of sports. This first one, you probably know.

The boy's father could tell something was different. At six months. old, the boy could balance on his father's palm as he walked through their home. At seven months, his father gave him a putter to fool around with, and the boy dragged it everywhere he went in his little circular baby walker. At ten months, he climbed down from his high chair, trun dled over to a golf club that had been cut down to size for him, and imitated the swing he'd been watching in the garage. Because the father couldn't yet talk with his son, he drew pictures to show the boy how to place his hands on the club. "It is very difficult to communicate how to putt when the child is too young to talk," he would later note.

At two-an age when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list physical developmental milestones like "kicks a ball" and "stands on tiptoe-he went on national television and used a club tall enough to reach his shoulder to drive a ball past an admiring Bob Hope. That same year, he entered his first tournament, and won the ten-and-under division.

There was no time to waste. By three, the boy was learning how to play out of a "sand twap," and his father was mapping out his destiny. He knew his son had been chosen for this, and that it was his duty to

### CHAPTER 1 The Cult of the Head Start

ONE YEAR AND FOUR DAYS after World War II in Europe ended in un conditional surrender, Laszlo Polgar was born in a small town in Hungary-the seed of a new family. He had no grandmothers, no grandfathers, and no cousins; all had been wiped out in the Holocaust, along with his father's first wife and five children. Laszlo grew up deter mined to have a family, and a special one.

He prepped for fatherhood in college by poring over biographies of legendary thinkers, from Socrates to Einstein. He decided that tradi tional education was broken, and that he could make his own children. into geniuses, if he just gave them the right head start. By doing so, he would prove something far greater: that any child can be molded for eminence in any discipline. He just needed a wife who would go along with the plan..

Laszlo's mother had a friend, and the friend had a daughter, Klara. In 1965, Klara traveled to Budapest, where she met Laszlo in person. Laszlo didn't play hard to get; he spent the first visit telling Klara that he planned to have six children and that he would nurture them to brilliance. Klara returned home to her parents with a lukewarm review: she had "met a very interesting person," but could not imagine marrying him.

### CHAPTER 2

How the Wicked World Was Made

THE TOWN OF DUNEDIN sits at the base of a hilly peninsula that juts off of New Zealand's South Island into the South Pacific. The peninsula is famous for yellow-eyed penguins, and Dunedin boasts, demurely, the world's steepest residential street. It also features the University of Otago, the oldest university in New Zealand, and home to James Flynn, a professor of political studies who changed how psychologists think about thinking.

He started in 1981, intrigued by a thirty-year-old paper that reported IQ test scores of American soldiers in World Wars I and II. The World War II soldiers had performed better, by a lot. A World War I soldier who scored smack in the middle of his peers-the 50th percentile-would have made only the 22nd percentile compared to soldiers in World War II. Flynn wondered if perhaps civilians had experienced a similar improve ment. "I thought, if IQ gains had occurred anywhere," he told me, "maybe they had occurred everywhere." If he was right, psychologists had been missing something big right before their eyes.

Flynn wrote to researchers in other countries asking for data, and on a dull November Saturday in 1984, he found a letter in his university mailbox. It was from a Dutch researcher, and it contained years of raw. 

### CHAPTER 6 The Trouble with Too Much Grit

THE BOY'S MOTHER APPRECIATED music and art, but when the boy tried to freehand sketch the family cat, he proved such a deficient draftsman that he destroyed the picture and refused to try again. Instead, he spent his childhood in the Netherlands playing marbles or sledding with his little brother, but mostly just looking at things. A prominent parenting handbook advised against unsupervised wanderings that might "intoxi cate" a child's imagination, but he wandered alone for hours. He walked in storms, and at night. He walked for miles just to sit for hours watch ing a bird's nest, or following water bugs on their commutes across a brook. He was especially obsessed with collecting beetles, labeling each

one with its proper Latin species name. When he was thirteen, the boy was admitted to a brand-new school housed in a hulking former royal palace. It was so far from his home that he had to board with a local family. His mind was elsewhere during class, but he was a good student, and spent his free time memorizing poetry.

The art teacher was the faculty celebrity, an education pioneer who argued for design to become a central part of the national economic engine, That crusade was so successful it led the federal government to mandate freehand drawing classes in every public school. Rather than

the canvas like seaweed in the swirling rhythm of the night sky. It was just a few years from the recommended relegation to a draw

ing class for ten-year-olds. But that starry night, along with scores of other paintings in his new style, the one he devised amid a succession of failures, would launch a new era of art and inspire new conceptions of beauty and expression. Works that he dashed off in hours as experi ments over the final two years of his life would become some of the most valuable objects-culturally and monetarily-that have ever ex isted in the world.

It is a myth that Vincent van Gogh died in anonymity. An ecstatic re view cast him as a revolutionary months before he died, and made him the talk of Paris. Claude Monet, the dean of impressionism-the move ment Van Gogh ignored, lamented, and then innovated upon-declared Van Gogh's work the cream of an annual exhibition.

Adjusted for inflation, four of Van Gogh's paintings have sold for more than $100 million, and they weren't even the most famous ones. His work now graces everything from socks to cell phone covers and an eponymous vodka brand. But he reached far beyond commerce.

-What artists do changed because of Vincent Van Gogh," artist and writer Steven Naifeh told me. (Naifeh, with Gregory White Smith, wrote "the definitive biography," according to a curator of the Van Gogh Museum.) Van Gogh's paintings served as a bridge to modern art and inspired a widespread devotion that no artist, perhaps no person, has equaled. Teenagers who have never visited a museum tape his art to their walls; Japanese travelers leave the ashes of their ancestors at his grave. In 2016, the Art Institute of Chicago displayed together all three iconic "Bedrooms"-pictures meant "to rest the brain, or rather the imagination," according to Van Gogh; the record number of visitors. 

And yet had Van Gogh died at thirty-four rather than thirty-seven (life expectancy in the Netherlands when he was born was forty), he might not even merit a historical footnote. The same goes for Paul Gauguin, a painter who briefly lived with Van Gogh and innovated a style known as synthetism, in which bold lines separated sections of bril liant color, without the subtle gradations of classical painting. He, too. became one of the few artists to crack the $100 million barrier. He spent the first six years of his professional life with the merchant marine before he found his calling: bourgeois stockbroker. Only after the market crash of 1882 did Gauguin become a full-time artist, at the age of thirty-five. His switch is reminiscent of J. K. Rowling's. She "failed on an epic scale" in her twenties, she once said, personally and professionally. A short marriage "imploded," and she was a single mother and unemployed for mer teacher on welfare. Like Van Gogh in the coal country and Gauguin after the crash, she was "set free" by failure to try work that better matched her talents and interests.

They all appear to have excelled in spite of their late starts. It would be easy enough to cherry-pick stories of exceptional late developers over coming the odds. But they aren't exceptions by virtue of their late starts, and those late starts did not stack the odds against them. Their late starts were integral to their eventual success.

"Match quality" is a term economists use to describe the degree of fit between the work someone does and who they are-their abilities and proclivities.

Northwestern University economist Ofer Malamud's inspiration for studying match quality was personal experience. He was born in Israel, but his father worked for a shipping company, and when Malamud was nine the family moved to Hong Kong, where he attended an English

### CHAPTER 10 Fooled by Expertise

THE BET WAS ON, and it was over the fate of humanity. On one side was Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich. In congressional tes

timony, on The Tonight Show (twenty times), and in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, Ehrlich insisted that it was too late to prevent a doomsday apocalypse from overpopulation. On its lower left corner, the book cover bore an image of a fuse burning low, and a reminder that the "bomb keeps ticking." Resource shortages would cause hundreds of millions of starvation deaths within a decade, Ehrlich warned. The New Republic alerted the world that the global population had already out stripped the food supply. "The famine has started," it proclaimed. It was cold, hard math: human population was growing exponentially, the food supply was not. Ehrlich was a butterfly specialist, and an accomplished one. He knew full well that #nature did not regulate animal populations delicately. Populations exploded, blew past the available resources, and crashed. "The shape of the population growth curve is one familiar to the biologist," he wrote.

Ehrlich played out hypothetical scenarios in his book, representing the kinds of disasters that will occur." In one scenario, during the 1970s the United States and China start blaming one another for mass
