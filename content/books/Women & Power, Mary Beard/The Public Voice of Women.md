I WANT TO START Very near the beginning of the tradition of Western literature, and its **first recorded example of a man telling a woman to 'shut up'; telling her that her voice was not to be heard in public.** I am thinking of a moment immortalised at the start of Homer's Odyssey, almost **3,000 years ago**. We tend now to think of the Odyssey as the epic story of Odysseus and the adventures and scrapes he had returning home after the Trojan War - while for decades his wife Penelope loyally waited for him, fending off the suitors who were pressing to marry her. **But the Odyssey is just as much the story of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus and Penelope. It is the story of his growing up and how over the course of the poem he matures from boy to man.** That process starts in the first book of the poem when Penelope comes down from her private quarters into the great hall of the palace, to find a bard performing to throngs of her suitors; he is singing about the difficulties the Greek heroes are having in reaching home. She isn't amused, and in front of everyone she asks him to choose another, happier number. At which point young Telemachus intervenes: **'Mother,' he says, 'go back up into your quarters, and take up your own work, the loom and the distaff speech will be the business of men, all men, and of me most of all; for mine is the power in this household.' And off she goes, back upstairs.**

There is something faintly ridiculous about this wet-behind-the-ears lad shutting up the savvy, middle-aged Penelope. But it is a nice demonstration that right where written evidence for Western culture starts, women's voices are not being heard in the public sphere. **More than that, as Homer has it, an integral part of growing up, as a man, is learning to take control of public utterance and to silence the female of the species**. **The actual words Telemachus uses are significant too. When he says 'speech' is 'men's business', the word is muthos - not in the sense that it has come down to us of 'myth'. In Homeric Greek it signals authoritative public speech, not the kind of chatting, prattling or gossip that anyone included, or especially women - women could do.**

What interests me is the relationship between this classic Homeric moment of silencing a woman and some of the ways in which women's voices are not publicly heard in our own contemporary culture, and in our own politics from the front bench to the shop floor. It is a well-known deafness that's nicely parodied in an old Punch cartoon

My aim here is to take a long view, a very long view, on the culturally awkward relationship between the voice of women and the public sphere of speech-making, debate and comment: politics in its widest sense, from office committees to the floor of the House. I am hoping that the long view will help us get beyond the simple diagnosis of 'misogyny' that we tend a bit lazily to fall back on. To be sure, **'misogyny' is one way of describing what's going on**. (If you go on a television discussion programme and then receive a load of tweets comparing your genitalia to a variety of unpleasantly rotting vegetables, it's hard to find a more apt word.) **But if we want to understand - and do something about - the fact that women, even when they are not silenced, still have to pay a very high price for being heard, we need to recognise that it is a bit more complicated and that there is a long back-story.**
