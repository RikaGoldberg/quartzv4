### Summary

This is a special book that draws from Mary Beard's deep knowledge of Classics. She provides examples, analogies, and anecdotes from Greek & Roman mythology to show how Western culture from inception has mistreated, silenced, and inappropriately punished women. It would pair well with Elizabeth Lesser's book, [Cassandra Speaks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49397876-cassandra-speaks)
