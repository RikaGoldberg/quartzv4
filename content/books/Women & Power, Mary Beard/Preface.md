### Highlights

WOMEN IN THE WEST have a lot to celebrate; let's not forget. My mother was born before women had the vote in parliamentary elections in Britain. She lived to see a female Prime Minister. **Whatever her views of Margaret Thatcher, she was pleased that a woman had reached Number 10 and proud to have had a stake herself in some of those revolutionary changes of the twentieth century.** **Unlike generations before her, she was able to have a career and marriage and a child (for her own mother pregnancy necessarily meant the end of her job as a teacher).** 

But my mother also knew that it was not all quite so simple, that real equality between women and men was still a thing of the future, **and that there were causes for anger as well as for celebration**. She always regretted not going to university (and was selflessly pleased that I was able to do just that). She was often frustrated that her views and her voice were not taken as seriously as she hoped they would be. And, though she would have been puzzled at the metaphor of the 'glass ceiling', she was well aware that the further up the career hierarchy she went, the fewer female faces she saw.
