### Quotes

“When it comes to understanding **how dominance works**, “there is so much we can learn from bonobos,” adds Parish. For this species at least, it has nothing to do with size. Bonobo females are on average slightly smaller than the males, the same way that chimpanzee females are slightly smaller than their males. **What sets them apart is that bonobo females form tight social bonds with each other even when they’re not related, cementing those relationships and easing tensions by rubbing their genitals together. These intimate social networks create power, locking out the possibility for individual males to dominate the group.”**

“But as we know from bonobos, we can’t assume that average physical differences in size or strength between the sexes necessarily lead to a steep imbalance of power at the level of society as a whole. There’s no biological rule here.”

“ Even feminists, argues the sociologist Christine Delphy, have leaned on biological arguments to explain women’s status, seeing patriarchy as having its roots in a natural division of labor between the sexes, or in an overwhelming male instinct to control female sexuality. “Naturalism is, of course, even more obvious in anti-feminist thinking,” she writes, “but it is still present in large measure in feminism.”

“The trouble with the entire line of reasoning employed by Johann Jakob Bachofen in 1861, then Lewis Morgan and Friedrich Engels soon after him, is that, as the anthropologist Adam Kuper notes in his book The Invention of Primitive Society, human societies don’t all necessarily trace back to one single point, to a time when everyone lived the same way. **We may be able to draw some common threads, writes Kuper, but there are no “fossils of social organization.**”
