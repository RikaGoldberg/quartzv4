### Notes
I asked my Twitter friends which female authors impacted them the most and Haider & Yalor both said Ayn Rand.

 So I picked up the [Ayn Rand Reader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37682.Ayn_Rand_Reader) to understand her philosophy for myself. 

My friend Davin is really salty about Ayn Rand. He says it's a book for people who have read a total of 5 books in their life. And people use it as an excuse to not have empathy.

**Ayn Rand is against altruism. She calls the suffering parasites, and the altruists as perpetrators of the suffering cycle. 

Ayn also denies intergenerational trauma and is anti affirmative action. She makes the case for reverse discrimination i.e, affirmative action discriminates against whites. 

I think this is ludicrous. Not once does she talk about how diversity is extremely important to a flourishing society.** 

I'm wondering now, does it really matter that Ayn Rand is against altruism and compassion? Our beliefs change. I think it's a problem only if people to this day read Ayn Rand and buy into her belief system. There's a lot more research though these days about the science of emotions. Even the science of being stuck. The softer science, the psychology is so important. 

Reminds me of the Zen saying, "in 100 years, all new people." Screw Ayn Rand. She's not worth my time. Focus on better. 

[Donella Meadows](/content/notes/Donella%20Meadows.md) advocates for diversity in systems, borrowing from nature, and [Noah Smith](/notes/Noah%20Smith.md) also advocates for diversity. 

### Quotes
"Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see others suffer-in order that he may be virtuous. Such is the #nature of altruism. The creator is not concerned with disease, but with life. Yet the work of the creators has eliminated one form of disease after another, in man's body and spirit, and brought more relief from suffering than any altruist could ever conceive."

"By his own effort and neither sacrifices himself nor others. It means that altruism permits no view of men except as sacrificial animals and profiteers-on-sacrifice, as victims and parasites that it permits no concept of a benevolent co-existence among men-that it permits no concept of justice.

If you wonder about the reasons behind the ugly mixture of cynicism and guilt in which most men spend their lives, these are the reasons: cynicism, because they neither practice nor accept the altruist morality-guilt, because they dare not reject it. 

This creative faculty cannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can give another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of survival.

"Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways-by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. 

**The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces nature alone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary**.

**The creator's concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite's concern is the conquest of men.**

"The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive.

"The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.

"The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. "Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self."

The man who attempts to live  for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality-the man who lives to serve others-is the slave. If physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit? The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resisted and of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence of altruism.

"Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution-or there will be nothing to distribute."
