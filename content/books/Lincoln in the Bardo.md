I saw in my messages to Davin/Maressa from 1.5 years ago that I want to read Lincoln in the Bardo.

AND THIS: 

A beautiful excerpt from George Saunder's newsletter. TL;DR a high school teacher reached out to George asking if his students could send George some questions to answer. His students are reading George's book, "Lincoln in the Bardo." Here's what George writes about the exchange.  
  
"I am finding this world we’re in increasingly confusing. Sometimes it feels like our systems are breaking down, generosity is fading, the bad people are winning, and so on. And then something like this exchange happens, and I realize that goodness – however we want to define it – is profoundly incremental. We make this choice rather than that one; we believe in something and live into it, even in the smallest way; we err in the direction of caring and trust. I might, on a given day, have a feeling that our educational system is going downhill. Then someone like Mr. Lewandowski and his students appear. And I think: Well, all systems (any system) are only kept afloat by individual acts of care and heroism and engagement - a kind of viral transfer occurs of the essential values."
