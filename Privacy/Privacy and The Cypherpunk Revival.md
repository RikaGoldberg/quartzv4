If you told someone a year ago that privacy would be one of the forefront narratives in crypto, some of you would have been enthusiastically hopeful but few would have actually believed you. Privacy has always been a north star to achieve, it is of the same self-sovereign cloth that brought Bitcoin, Ethereum and the rest of the space into existence. But the reasons privacy mattered were often forgotten and overlooked in favor of the hot meta of the movement.

Yet, something happened in Q4 of 2025 that for the first time in a long time brought privacy front and center. Zcash (ZEC), the privacy-first cryptocurrency, went from being priced at a low of under $50 in late September to a high over $700 in November. To many, the move came out of nowhere while to some, the release of the user-friendly Zashi wallet brought increased interest back to ZEC. On a deeper level, what Zcash’s run represented was a canary in the coal mine of a broader shift that is happening; that privacy and selective disclosure that comes with it would be the tip of the spear of The Cypherpunk Revival.

Two kinds of investors here - those who want money, and those who want freedom.

This fault line is not a new development but has been forming over the years as a new class of participants are onboarded onchain. These users' values, goals, and preferences are much different than those from earlier eras of crypto. While this is a sign of growth, it is also a sign of changes to come.

Two people who noticed this inflection point happening from miles away were DarkFi developers Amir Taaki (

) and R-R O’Leary (

[@lunar_mining](https://x.com/@lunar_mining)

) who I was able to interview at LISCON in October 2021. At the time, people were hopeful of crypto’s and specifically DeFi’s revolutionary potential. A few months prior even, CT’s favorite anons at the moment graced the cover of Fortune with the title of that month being “Crypto vs. Wall Street” and the byline “How The Well-Funded Tech Rebels Behind “Decentralized Finance” Plan To Unseat Today’s Financial Giants.” Yet, Taaki warned that DeFi was not going to turn out like the revolution most people imagined where the major players would magically step aside in favor of upstarts. In fact, Taaki

[predicted](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/liscon-recap?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

a much different future, one where “DeFi will inevitably split into two. Regulated Finance or RegFi is a severely watered-down version of DeFi that is not much different than TradFi today. And then those who want sovereignty in their interactions will be forced into the darkness.”

Acceptance Through Absorbation

It is not a coincidence that privacy started to gain momentum at the same time that entrenched powers have been genuinely adopting crypto. We see this with ETFs being approved for majors like BTC, ETH, & SOL, the GENIUS Act being passed for stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act is making its way through Congress which if passed will create a market structure for the remaining cryptocurrencies. What all three of these developments have in common is that crypto is no longer a fringe toy espoused by ideologues but a practical technology with real-world use. But normalization does not come without its tradeoffs, institutions have to follow strict compliance requirements and mandates that force them to pick and choose which properties they absorb and which they discard.

While ETFs increase mainstream crypto adoption and maintain price exposure, they also reduce participation and agency by removing the very attributes that gave those assets value in the first place. These attributes and properties include ==[[sovereignty]] (not your keys, not your coins), optionality (no choice in how to use each asset and participate in each network), and trustless decentralization (brokerage accounts rely on faith in platforms)==. By transforming digital assets from tools of sovereignty to merely vehicles of price exposure, ETFs allow institutions and individuals to bet on crypto without participating in it.

Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act marks a turning point because it is the first time that crypto through the subcategory of stablecoins is recognized by Federal law. By treating stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, a bright line is drawn that outlines the rules around reserves, issuance and what is required to be compliant. In this regard, stablecoins show that crypto is no longer being attacked by bans but being absorbed through normalization. In the past year alone, there are reports of multiple stablecoin initiatives by major players that range from

to

to

[Klarna](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/klarna-launch-dollar-backed-stablecoin-race-digital-payments-heats-up-2025-11-25/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

, showing after years of waiting on the sidelines that they are ready to step onto the field.

Crucially, pending passage into law, the CLARITY Act will define which cryptocurrencies and digital assets are commodities, which are securities, and which government agencies oversee them. In many ways, this Act is the final piece of the puzzle before the chasm is fully crossed when adoption shifts from experimenters and early believers to mainstream institutions and everyday consumers. In addition, by outlining rules, guidance, and frameworks, the risk of creating a digital asset goes to a minimum, making it safer for organizations both large and small to issue their own. Whether the CLARITY Act passes or not does not matter because it is a sign for what is to come. It’s not a matter of if regulation for digital assets will happen, just when. Just like the GENIUS Act, through institutionalization, the CLARITY Act will quietly favor assets that are transparent, attributable, and censorable, shaping which assets get built and who can own said assets. An effect of this is that it will push sovereignty-oriented designs to the margins and force innovation in this category to occur elsewhere. Moreover, just like ETFs, the acceptance of digital assets by the traditional financial regime and powers that be completes the shift from crypto as a collective of sovereign systems to it as different variants of regulated infrastructure, ultimately leaving the cypherpunk ethos to survive elsewhere.

Rediscovering the Ethos

==What originally brought crypto its value was not acceptance but usefulness and as the properties that made it useful are stripped away, it leads many to ask why we are here to begin with.==

This is what the Cypherpunk Revival is about, it is not a rejection of crypto’s growth but rather a reaction to its successful adoption and a reasserting of those original cypherpunk values that made crypto worth adopting, growing, and preserving in the first place. Those values include ==self-sovereignty where users control their assets and identities without intermediaries, minimal trust where systems assume adversarial conditions rather than good faith, and user-controlled disclosure where participation does not require being fully seen==.

These principles do not rely on promises but are instead enforced by cryptography. Bitcoin proved that this model could work at scale by establishing a system of optionality: an escape hatch from legacy finance into a parallel system governed by rules instead of permissions. The Cypherpunk Revival extends that logic beyond the agency to participate to now includes agency to reveal as core properties of equal importance in the self-sovereign stack.

==Yet, to cypherpunks and even Satoshi, Bitcoin was always incomplete. Due to limits at the time of its creation, Bitcoin could not fully protect the identities of addresses. That is because while mitigations could be done to hide privacy, Bitcoin did not have a system’s level mechanism for guaranteeing privacy.== In this sense, the Cypherpunk Revival is about finishing the job: creating truly sovereign money that has privacy ingrained in the core of the system, enabling selective identity disclosure by design.

Bitcoin is a transparent ledger meaning anyone could see and link individuals to address(es). Hughes and the cypherpunks foresaw this reality and consequences pertaining to it and wrote:

“When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.

Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.”

Cypherpunks concluded that privacy can only be achieved if it is an emergent property of systems and not just a feature that is bolted on later. There are only a handful of systems today that would qualify as privacy-preserving systems, Monero and Zcash (when shielded) preserve it at the monetary layer; Tor and I2P preserve it at the network layer; tools like Tails and SecureDrop protect it at the operational layer. What unites all of these systems are a design that makes identity optional, and participation does not require being seen. And it is here where the Cypherpunk Revival takes off, one where systems that have selective identity disclosure as a core part of its infrastructure.

Consequences of Total Transparency

We do not need to imagine hypothetical scenarios of overreach, the consequences of transparent blockchains can be seen after years of onchain activity. Like predators hiding in bushes watching their prey, public mempools are closely monitored for opportunities. When users submit transactions to the public mempool, they reveal (without choice) their intentions before their action is finalized and executed. It is here where

[MEV](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-mev-maximal-extractable-value-crypto)

is captured by specialized actors such as bots, searchers, and arbitrageurs who identify exploitable intent and act upon it. Examples of MEV are sandwich attacks, frontrunning/backrunning, sniping, etc. While a single transaction in isolation only has minimal information leakage of a user, repeated behavior from the same addresses that are public and traceable for the world to see can profile users into behavior demographics, making them easy targets for future extraction.

This dynamic ultimately degrades the onchain experience for everyone. Retail users, in particular, do not return to environments where they are repeatedly taken advantage of; at some point they either run out of money or simply get tired of it. Because of total onchain visibility, what begins as unconstrained participation quickly turns into a zero-sum environment, where speed, capital, and privileged access determine outcomes, and opportunities are rapidly arbitraged, commodified, and driven toward zero. In such systems, value is not created but extracted. Extraction is inherently finite which leads to thinner margins and worse execution, which, like a decades-long strip-mining operation, results in a hollowed-out commons. ==This is why fully transparent markets are always destined to become a race to the bottom: once everything is visible, nothing is defensible, and the system cannibalizes itself until there is nothing left to capture.==

With blockchains as they are today, users do not have a choice on what information they share about themselves, it is public by default. The consequences of this do not only stay onchain, it also poses immediate threats offline. In 2025, there was a noticeable uptick in

[wrench attacks](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/wrench-attack?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

, the use of physical violence to force someone to surrender their cryptocurrency, with a record of

[70](https://www.theblock.co/post/384018/record-year-wrench-attacks-how-crypto-holders-maintain-physical-security-rising-risks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

being logged by OG Bitcoiner and security expert Jameson Lopp. These attacks are made possible by linking clusters of addresses onchain to identities offchain and then tying identities to personal information such as addresses, associates, etc. making themselves and their loved ones targets for assault, kidnapping, and home invasions.

Far from being anomalies, these attacks are the predictable outcomes of systems where identity exposure is the default. When participation in systems requires being legible, even in sovereign ones, users are turned into targets. In this sense, privacy is no longer a matter of ideology but of basic security, and the absence of it has real-world consequences.

Privacy Today and Selective Disclosure

The Cypherpunk Revival and the call to privacy are not optional preferences but a civilization-wide requirement for the 21st century. This isn’t a radical demand. Privacy is already a part of our daily lives. ==Traditional examples of privacy being a part of societal institutions include medical records being protected by law, conversations with lawyers being deemed privileged information, journalists shielding sources to protect them and their stories, etc. ==In a group context, certain institutions operate under Chatham House Rules, where information discussed in a session may be used but

[never](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)

attributed. Notably, in regulated financial markets,

[roughly a third to nearly half](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/market-transparency-reporting/equity/otc-market-share)

of trading occurs away from public order books in dark pools and off-exchange venues; a structural recognition that total visibility impairs execution. What these cases have in common is that privacy is a core property of society’s infrastructure and integral for all of these institutions to function properly.

Pen names and pseudonyms have existed for millennia preceding the internet age. In ancient religious texts, pseudonyms were a common practice in order to bestow authority, continuity, and legitimacy. In the early days of the United States, The Federalist Papers were written with pseudonyms in order to focus on the merits of the argument instead of the background of the arguer. Well known authors George Orwell and Voltaire were actually pen names used by them so they could freely criticize power without fear of retribution.

Historically online, users had the liberty to reveal what they wanted about their identity. These practices ranged from default anonymous posting on 4chan to writing a blog under a pseudonym to having multiple “alts” on X/Twitter. Alts on X/Twitter are especially reminiscent of the heteronyms used by Fernando Pessoa where he contrived of different identities with distinct biographies, philosophical worldviews, belief systems, and even unique writing styles. His heteronyms would often contradict one another which allowed for a multiplicity of ideas to exist without being forced to resolve them into an authoritative “truth”. Through multiplicity, Pessoa was able to explore, test, and abandon ideas freely without reducing himself to a specific allegiance.

There is no better demonstration of identity being used as a tool than Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous persona behind Bitcoin. ==Their departure from project development and the world was not an accident, it was a statement of the new order they were aiming to enable with self-sovereign money and software. As a tool, the identity Satoshi was deployed deliberately and used within a specific context: to introduce Bitcoin, establish its credibility, and shepherd its early development and community. ==Once the system reached a certain level of attention by curious outsiders, that same identity shifted from asset to liability which prompted Satoshi to vanish. In doing so, Satoshi demonstrated the power of selective disclosure. Had their identity been revealed, it would have altered the perception and ultimately the value of Bitcoin itself. The disappearance ensured that Bitcoin could stand on its own with authority coming from the system's participants rather than its creator. Furthermore, the few years of Satoshi being active offered a glimpse into a future where identities are not fixed but contextual, appearing when useful and receding when necessary, and how such fluidity could reshape traditional social and institutional dynamics.

Whether it’s Satoshi with his creation, Pessoa in his writings, authors having pseudonyms, or anons posting as anons, what they all have in common is that identity is not a fate that you cannot change, but rather a tool to be wielded to both protect yourself and serve your goals==. What this illustrates is that privacy and selective disclosure work less like a one-size-fits-all blanket and more like granular binary code. ==Ones reveal, zeros withhold; the pattern matters. What you choose to disclose and what you choose to withhold directly shapes the meaning of what you are signaling entirely. This is why we accept, almost intuitively, that different contexts require different levels of disclosure and why complete transparency is not a moral ideal but a systematic flaw.

## 

The Choice Before Us

Crypto did not fracture at the point of failure, but at the moment of acceptance. As the industry became normalized, what Taaki described as of RegFi, DeFi’s regulated mirror, emerged and the perimeter of what was permissible narrowed. ==Yet what laid beyond the perimeter was the unfinished work of full digital self-sovereignty. The timing of The Cypherpunk Revival is not accidental. Geopolitical instability, expanding surveillance, financial censorship, and permanent digital records are no longer abstract risks but everyday realities. In such an environment, privacy becomes a necessity.==

The cypherpunk ethos never disappeared, it persisted in the shadows wherever technology was used for empowerment and not for control. This split is the quiet divide that Naval Ravikant articulated so plainly: between those who seek participation in systems of accumulation without agency and those who gravitate toward systems that have privacy embedded by design. In this sense, The [[Cypherpunk Revival]] ==is about reclaiming the social order the original cypherpunks sought to establish, one that places primacy on self-sovereignty, optionality, and selective disclosure.
