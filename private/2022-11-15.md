Yesterday, Alex was on my mind. Today is Foster. 

The thing is that I need to recognize Foster for what it is and not think it will give me something that it can't. Foster is a business -- first & foremost. 

Foster people also care a lot about being compassionate and the whole buddhism thing. I used to subscribe to it, and I guess I still do, but they go overboard, imo, now, like when Caryn was hurt and she said I just feel so much compassion towards this other person. I know what she means because I used to subscribe to that too. But now, I'm like no, you hurt me, you're done. I don't care about the struggles I think you are experiencing in your life. Because that's just too much for me to deal. I can't deal with other people's problems when I have enough of my own. 

And Dan. He is possibly a cult leader. And he kind of wants to be that. He's a deeply troubled visionary founder. Aren't they all? I think he's also not a great editor. He's not skilled in writing. He writes well and he writes for an online audience but he's not an intellectual person. He's also entitled, he talked about not knowing even to this day how to clean or do house things or assemble furniture. He just hires people to do all of that from upwork. 

A part of me feels lucky that I am working within Foster. It's a 'real' DAO, well no it's not on chain yet. I am getting paid a little bit, but I don't see things happening on-chain.
