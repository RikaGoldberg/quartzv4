Running a startup is really really really hard. One more for emphasis: really..hard.

Why? 

Because you are charting unchartered territory. There is no map. You are creating one and then hopefully passing it down to the youngn’s that come after you. 

But no matter how amazing your map is, it is not a magic pill. 

Humans are way more complex than that. We have a tendency to not listen to others, to think that “this will never happen to me”, or that “I am special.” So when you hand someone your map and say “follow this path,” be prepared for pushback. 

As any parent or close friend knows, giving someone advice, even if it is well intentioned, usually backfires. 

Acquiring wisdom and growing gray hairs is a result of better understanding human psychology. This comes with living life, making mistakes, and then thoughtfully processing your mistakes. 

Books, art, and music are helpful tools for processing mistakes, but you have to be ready to receive the information. If you have not lived through hard things like war, betrayal, and heartbreak, you will not understand the messages of books, art, and music. 

Circling back to where I started: startups are really really hard. 

Some startup teams have people who have never founded a company before. This is dangerous because 

Startups usually have people who are more experienced than others. They have founded companies before, they were in the space for longer, 

We tend to either be too trusting of others or not trusting enough. 

Life experience is priceless, but unfortunately it cannot just be handed down. People need to make mistakes to learn valuable lessons. 

Parents know this rule of life. Friends know this too. 

You can’t just dole out advice. Even if you’re right. There is an art to delivering feedback and to guiding a person towards right decisions. 

It takes courage. It’s much easier to ignore or gloss over bad or unhealthy behavior, to hope that it will get better, or to convince yourself that “everything happens for a reason.” 

At a startup, 

As anyone who has given someone a playbook, or doled out advice, knows, advice

Foster is an online community where writers can find and submit vulnerable, personal writing. Foster writers cut through the bullshit of “just in time” content that covers news headlines and emotion

Foster Narrative
Foster is a place where writers come to read and write personal, vulnerable content. This is what first attracted me to Foster, and I imagine it’s what attracted many other people too. Fosterati help each other to deal with the challenging emotions of writing and showing up each day. Another unique part about foster is its Web3 culture. We like Writing NFTs and supporting writers by paying them. 

Foster wants to build a new type of narrative engine. One that surfaces content that is most ‘alive’ that doesn’t play the content marketing game, the SEO, the “just in time” news content that we see on the Internet. Foster DAO wants to reward people for sharing deeply personal stories, whereas Foster C-Corp is “just in time” content, marketing stuff, degen stuff, etc. 








At Foster, some people write “de

In July, I wrote a proposal for Foster Governance to embark on a research project of different governance models in DAOs. 

Why? 

Because people did not have clear roles and it was confusing who is doing what when. I thought by better understanding how groups in the past have made decisions would help us to have better insight into who is donig what so we can have a well oiled publication machine. 

As a decentralized media company, we want to be releasing a publication each week. Sourcing, writing, editing, publishing needs to come from the community. 

The future that we envision is decentralized media. This idea of a headless brand where writers have autonomy to write what they want under the Foster umbrella. Like A16Z. This is different than other places because the writers have more autonomy? 

Has Coordinape actually been helpful to identify what activities are prized and what are not? Do we have a good way to raise people up who need it? To really give people more money who need it or who have done something really outstanding? 

Not sure, actually. Some data analysis may be necessary in Coordinape to see patterns. 

DAOs are challenging because people don’t have clear roles. Or do they? We all gravitate towards what is interesting. Sara is editor. Sam is PM. Rob is mentor. Caryn is sourcer. Rika is metagov. Rotating sourcer/editor. 

Don’t have a good way to give or receive feedback. Like hey you are introducing tooling that is unnecessary. Let’s talk about what you are trying to accomplish here. Why do you want a wiki? To build in public…
