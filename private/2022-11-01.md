I have been sleeping later these days. Waking up at 930, versus my usual 730-830 during the summer months. 

I'm just going with it.  No problem. 

I made an index card that says: whatever it takes, figure out your financial spreadsheet and goals. 

This is like my soundbar installation, or the router hack. All things that I just had to dive in and do. It would take time and feeling uncomfortable...this is another one of those things. I gotta do it this week of November 1st. 

Do it in the morning. When fresh.
