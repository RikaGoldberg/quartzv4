Wednesday. I have been sleeping poorly this week. Last night, neighbors were having a party then moving furniture. I woke up many times. Same with night before. I was thinking a lot about how Emily is bad shit crazy. Wow. It is insane how a mom can be so nuts. I want nothing to do with her or with a family like that because it's fucking crazy. I got stung once and no more.
