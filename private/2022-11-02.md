What an eventful start to November!

I am going on a date with a new man I met at Bloom Coffee. I feel really excited about it because he seems mature and interesting. And I feel a physical attraction to him. I am intrigued. 

MetaCartel is experiencing a ton of drama. This is the first time I'm witnessing DAO drama. 
I do like how people are speaking their mind and being honest with one another. 

I'm going on the Foster retreat tomorrow. 

Autumnal weather is so pleasant. The seasons feel amazing. 

I said "no" to the gays. I'm on the fence about my neigbor...mostly "no" to her too because she's immature.

I'm going to DJ one day
