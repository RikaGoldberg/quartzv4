Looking back at morning pages, yesterday, was helpful. I have a love-hate relationship with journaling because I tend to write self-focused things that are heated and reactive, in the moment. Journaling for me is a cathartic experience. But I think that's narcissistic. 

The question I should be asking myself is: "what will what I write in my journal help me with later? When I look back at my journal, what will future me bet thankful to present me for writing?"

Today, the answer is about my writing. Professional writing. I want to write a newsletter that meets my needs and also the needs of the Internet. Like it or not, I am playing the Internet game now. I am writing punchy content for an Internet audience with a short attention span. I want my newsletters to be short, to share my unique perspective, and stick in the minds of readers for several days, weeks, months? 

I no longer want to write stream of consciousness writing. It's self-serving. I want my writing to draw from history and incorporate current events. In two years, I want my writing to continue to be prescient for myself and for my readers. 

Accountability is on my mind.

>Wouldn’t it be better if we could be kinder, but firmer? How would our lives be different if there were less anger and more accountability? What would our work and home lives look like if we blamed less but had more respect for boundaries?

 >The heart of compassion is really acceptance.The better we are at accepting ourselves and others, the more compassionate we become.Well, it’s difficult to accept people when they are hurting us or taking advantage of us or walking all over us. This research has taught me that if we really want to practice compassion, we have to start by setting boundaries and holding people accountable for their behavior.

>It’s also important that we can lean into the discomfort that comes with straddling compassion and boundaries. We have to stay away from convincing ourselves that we hate someone or that they deserve to feel bad so that we can feel better about holding them accountable. That’s where we get into trouble. When we talk ourselves into disliking someone so we’re more comfortable holding them accountable, we’re priming ourselves for the shame and blame game.

I am working on a community piece with Leo. I finished a Uniswap piece on DeFi. I want to know what kind of writing I will be doing for Uniswap? What is the process like for writing and editing? I want to learn more about the expectations. Am I fit for those expectations? Clearly, since I moved on after the writing assignment, they liked my writing style and think I am smart about crypto and a good writer. I'm knowledgeable about writing. What else do they want from me? 

I want to publish my newsletter today. About systems. Accountability in systems. 

I read Breathe...what did I gain from it? There are probably some good things to highlight in the book. 

I started to re-read How the Internet Happened. Why? I like history and learning about how technology came to be and how innovation happened. Because crypto, DAOs, governance are on the edge of new tech. I am working in innovation. And its really polarizing. The Internet was too. 

Similarities between crypto and the early Internet -- many!
