Grateful for Victory Point & for this Chocolate Croissant & this coffee. 

I went to Albany Bulb this morning. Met a blonde woman with a ShebaPoodle. So friendly, smart, a sweetheart for sure. 

On my mind is nervous system regulation. Realizing we all get caught up in our heads, when really it all starts from the nervous system - a layer deeper. I would like to read Porgis' original polyvagal theory paper. 

Talking to different people --sharing -- has given me a lot of perspective on my relationship with Harry. I identified a problem and acted on it: informing friends of ours so they could talk with him. This didn't seem to work. At least no short-term results. He is still so dead set on separating. Getting a divorce. 

My latest thinking is aligned to what I have been experiencing for a while but couldn't put it into words and I think this is also something we have backwards in our society. People are quick to say, just let go. It's not working so let go. Bygones be bygones. Move on. This seems like the mainstream view of friendships and relationships. 

Yet, people also say that process is more important than outcome (some people). The AI book proves this. This is not how we do it in our society. We focus on process, instead of on the process of 'becoming.' Which the latest psychology research, human psychology, logotherapy, these disciplines all say this. 

I told Sarah yesterday at Liz's baby shower that I want to get a job. Which one though? I don't know. There are stepping stones that I haven't crossed yet. 

The stepping stones of possibility. It really resonates a lot with me. What are the stepping stones? -<--lol. TELL ME fortune cookie lol

Having a job is like school where you get a bunch of tasks and things are structured. 

I suspect all people go through a phase of structure to less structure.
