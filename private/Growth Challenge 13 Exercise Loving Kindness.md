Reflect on what it felt like to send love toward someone you love, a stranger and yourself. How can you bring this loving-kindness into your daily life?

Unconditional love is what, I think, this is about. Practicing love towards a flawed human. My grandma talks about unconditional love towards your parents, but I think about standing up for injustice and racism and misogyny and exhibiting [[content/content/healthy assertiveness]] is important too. I really want to work on healthy assertiveness where I express my needs and wants. Loving kindness meditation can help me understand those needs and wants. That's what I'm thinking now.
