I wish Harry would do morning pages. He is just so far off the rocker. It's very sad. 

I still somehow, like in the Hope cartoon book, have Hope. Or like Merlin the adventure story depicts, we can figure out how to work together. Or like the book about Gifts. 

Writing has been good but collaborating and really getting involved with Web3 is totally the move. Because community is really important. And the Silicon Valley tech culture is toxic. Some of that has permeated crypto too. 

I don't think it's helpful to say this is toxic and this is not toxic. This good or this not good. It's a spiritual way of seeing things, right? Things are good. Or bad. Things just are. 

Everyone has these hobbies and things they are trying to do. Productivity crew says go, do them, go do them. 

In my newsletter, I can write about the trees and how lovely they are and spread the sanctuary vibes. 

With bipolar, there is certainly a chemical imbalance...

As a neurological problem, a stutter is ... idk but I know my stress and anxiety impacts it. 

Mental health is about managing it. Like when I write down thoughts, I can identify them as grandiose or depressed or anxious or tired or stressed. 

The shadow of journaling is that it is very one-sided. I am not a good assessor of my thoughts. Feedback from other people is really important. 

Actively trusting and communicating with another person. 

Cool. I'm done being in my head.
