Growth Challenge 11: Be socially curious

I did this exercise with mom and asked her all of the questions:
1. What would a perfect day be like?
2. If you could have a meal with anyone in the world, who would it be and why?
3. What would others say is your greatest strength, and why?
4. What is a dream you have for the near future? For the distant future? 

A perfect day, for her, would be to accomplish one thing, work or something else, like going to the gym. She wasn't sure who she would have a meal with, but after some prompting, she said a successful woman probably in business. Greatest strength, she punted back to me. I told her she's focused and committed when she sets her mind to something. She is fearful of her mom dying. Dreams, she told me has no dreams now because Covid is the cause of her not dreaming anymore..

I learned that she is like most people. Lives in the past and wishes she did things then that she knows now. Her physical health is good, but mental health probably not so good, so she feels like she can't commit to doing her passion. She is passionate about interior design and wants to create a business, but has no idea how and doesn't have the mental health and she doesn't like to take risks.
