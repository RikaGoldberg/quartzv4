I love talking with Alex. Although on our date yesterday, I felt on edge and anxious and that influenced my perception a lot. He has a bad haircut and he is short. His shoes were not polished. 

I like how he took charge. Ordered us drinks. Then, took control at the table. I can feel that he takes care of me. That he cares.
