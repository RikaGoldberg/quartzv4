So much of life is about mindset. All of life! It's all systems thinking. The way that parts relate to one another: whether that is a family system, or an economy, or what be it. 

For the FTX post, I have so much news and finance, but I need to read widely. 

So, today, read widely. I also have finances on my mind (always!) that I'm not doing enough. When money flows in regularly, you don't have to worry about putting your money to work or using it wisely or Opolis or whatever else. But I am worried about it. 

Using crypto projects gives me anxiety. It always has and it it always will. This is just the world that I live in. 

The anxiety is a choice, right? Somewhat?? 

What would give me less anxiety. Asking questions. Reading. Working.
