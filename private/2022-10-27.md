Shit, I really don't know how to get started today so I am doing Morning Pages. Ugh...morning pages is for losers.

I took the token engineering exam yesterday and kept failing even though I missed only a few questions. Then, I went into the Discord and realized it's not me...it's the way the exam is and other people are struggling too. They will release a new version tomorrow to see which questions you missed. With a pass rate that high, they have to..it's like being back in school. 

Crypto is great for people who like to be back in school. Who like to learn stuff that they actually care about. Like CCS was really good for that. 

I want to write a newsletter but I dunno know what I'm going to write! Hmm...i zon't know. 

I feel my newsletter wants to be leveled up. No more personal journaling type of content. It was helpful for me to grow emotionally and shed old identities and unlearn bad habits but now it's time to level up. 

What does that mean?

Right now, I'm drawing blanks. Let's see in Obsidian..what did I wanna write about. 

What are people interested in reading? 

I need some incentive/motivation to write now. My newsletter has to be read and spread and shared. It's time to grow. 

I want to get featured in Bankless? Or Lenny's newsletter?
