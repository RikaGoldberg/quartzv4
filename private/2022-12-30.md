Alex lost his temper with the server at Andaaz in Asheville. He said the server treated him like a child. Then, he roped me in by saying "she's mad at me right now." Excuse me, "she?" And roping me in was inappropriate. 

In the car, he was so angry and didn't want me touching him but then he calmed down. He was the one acting like a child. 

A few days prior on a walk on the beltline he told me that Emma talked to him like a child when she told him to warn her when he is sick. But it was prompted by me pointing out a block of ice to him and he said it makes him feel like a child. 

I want to understand why he gets triggered so much. Why does he have this deep seated problem of feeling like people make him feel like a child. 

Because I don't want to be around someone who gets triggered like that. It makes me feel scared and embarrassed and like I am less than him. Calling me "she" makes him feel like he doesn't care about me.

What small thoughtful gift would Alex like?
