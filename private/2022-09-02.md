I don't have clarity in where I am going with my writing. I want it to be more influential than it is. I don't want to just do these freelancing projects. I want my writing to be seen. Obviously. It's normal. But I have to be adding value to my audience. 

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Just keep writing. Audience will come find me if I just put my work out there.
