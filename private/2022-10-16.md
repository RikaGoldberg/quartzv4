Money in. Money out. Follow the rules and .. 

I want to make a lot of money and never make mistakes and for life to be purrrfect with my hundred cats LOL. Just kidding. I want a solid friend group. People who I enjoy to be around. 

I guess there are two types of activities that take place during the day. First, I have the activities that require measurement, metrics, rigidity in working on them. The steps are X, Y, Z. 

Next, I have more strategic activities. I enjoy this more. The community building, the working with people, the strategic work. 

What category is silly mistakes? 

Silliness.
