As highlighted in the [analysis done by Variant fund](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-2022) there are some stark differences between centralized crypto exchanges and decentralized crypto exchanges that are part of the ownership economy:
* Coinbase was founded in 2012, and employs 3,730 people as of 2021. In contrast, Uniswap was founded in 2018, and has less than 100 employees. With just 3% of the headcount of Coinbase, Uniswap does 73% of its trading volume.
* Uniswap makes its users owners via governance tokens and LP shares and users have the ability to add any token
* Coinbase went public in April 2021 and after its first private investment round, itâ€™s valuation multiplied by 40,809x. But every retail investor who purchased and held Coinbase stock since its public listing has lost money on their investment as of April 2022
    
> Unlike Coinbase, whose direct listing meant no new shares were issued when it went public, 60% of the UNI genesis supply was allocated to Uniswap users. This profile is commonly seen with projects in the ownership economy.
