Fucking duck. I paid for so much fucking rent without Harry paying a dime. I want to keep all of the furniture proceeds. I want to sell the bedroom furniture. I hope this can give me a shit ton of leverage. 

The future of writing is social, I hope!! 

In the future, writers can create NFTs on Mirror. 

I have been struggling to write about composability because it's boring. 

I feel like I'm in a liminal state now. I am metamorphising into someone else, but I'm not there yet. I am becoming, I am on the brink. Sooo close! So close. So close.
