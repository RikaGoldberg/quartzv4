Hey Katerina! I've been chewing on your latest post about Creativity and Community. (Btw cool subtitle -- a love story!) I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel like you're pulling on the thread of advice giving. Maybe I'm just in that mind set though because I'm struggling to find a way to share something important with a friend. I'm scared to share it because I don't know if she's ready to hear what I have to say. When I talk to her, I feel like it's a dance where I'm feeling her out and trying to read her thoughts and feelings. 

I feel like I'm trying to read Nethra's thoughts and feelings. Dancing the fine line of intuition and mind brain. 

She told me she's very private. She told me friends have given her advice about work and been judgmental, told her what to do and not respected her opinion. Yet she's in a job where she works too much and doesn't like it. 

Is making independent decisions the start to following your own intuition? It's not blatantly ignoring other people, but it's being confident in your needs.
