I cannot do any writing if I am not in the right headspace. This headspace cannot be forced. I cannot be tense or anxious. I need to be rested. I can't worry. lol. I mean it's okay to worry but I need to resolve it. The worry needs to be resolved. 

I have only been in the apartment settling in for just over a week.  Wanting things to move faster is being crazy like Harry. There is a limited amount that I can do. And that's okay. 

The things that matter are people, social support. It's fucking important. 

My toilet is running. I need to let MAA know. I want to make agua fresca. I want to write a blog post for Tally about DAOs but I need inspiration!!

I need to create a spreadsheet for DeFi things. 

I need to delegate, delegate, delegate. 

What are the things that only I can do? 

Maybe Julian's craft writing will be inspiration. 

The router is a personal thing. I like it. I like setting up and putzing with electronics and digital things. Shit i don't like doing, outsource!

Like maintenance. 

I like electronics. I like tinkering. I like writing. I like exploring the craft of writing. 

What is smthg interesting I can write about DAOs? Good question. V good. 

I have been going to sleep too late because I've been anxious and stressed. Last night was a good night's rest but I woke up many time, jolted out of bed. I was also hot. Turn down AC a little tonight. 

I feel comfy. Yas, indeed. In my rocket ship chair. K cool beans, son.

Tally blog post: 
Iâ€™m interested in the design space around working groups/sub groups. How are they implemented from a trustware and socialware perspective. What is working and what is not?

I'm curious about Dao's organizational system. Incentive system. How to proof memberâ€™s contribution? Using poap? How to measure their contribution ![ðŸ‘€](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f440.svg "Eyes") ?

How do DAOs deal with tension? What are the common solution (or approaches) to this human problem?
