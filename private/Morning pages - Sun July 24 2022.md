Digital Gardening is calling to me. I feel like I haven't found interesting content on the Internet to read. But I have also been spending less time on Twitter and in my online communities. I have not been reading the news, which is important, because it's what is happening in the world now. It is reality. Even though some of it is fake. I need to decipher what is real and what is not. Wars are real. In the Book Thief, families in Germany were not all prepared for war. Some of them didn't want to com to terms with it, like in the city of Molching. But some left. The ones who could. It is a privilege to leave? Maybe. That's one side. But it could be cowardly to leave? 

War. 

I feel stuck with my writing? 

In bed this morning, I created a haiku about assholes. Me thinks I was an asshole and it worked, but now that I am actively working on not being an asshole, instead on being vulnerable, it didn't work. 

I just can't believe how Harry was a fucking asshole to ME! to his wife... 
that is where the pain lies. 

So now I act like an asshole to him. Jews in Nazi Germany were not kind and compassionate to the Nazis. That would get you killed. 

Victor Frankl talks about the ones who survived as the ones who could create purpose and meaning out of their suffering. 

I need to focus on MY needs. Which is very very hard for me. Because I am a giving person. I thought giving was good... but the other person has to reciprocate.
