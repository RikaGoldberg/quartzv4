I am starting to feel overwhelmed by small things? 

Writing projects are done, but I'm still latching on to something...

Worry, fear...uncertainty. Its making me tense. Anxiety? Normal levels? 

I have things I need/want to do...

Month of Dec. reflection is staring at me.... 

Information Rules. Colony Whitepaper. Do it.
