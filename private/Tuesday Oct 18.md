I can make very different choices than my parents made. I can  build myself, and build a business, which means take virtually no salary for a future reward. 

I can maximize for high-value relationships, for learning, for investing. For being eventually an angel investor or someone startups/projects want me to invest in ... for my expertise? 

I would like to have a brand so I can get opportunities. Opportunities are intellectually stimulating. In crypto, I can do this more easily via my established networks. Metacartel, block science, others, right? People like me and want me. I am not a nobody like I am in traditional tech, at least now.
