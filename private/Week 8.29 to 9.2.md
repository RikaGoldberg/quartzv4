Monday Aug. 29: Had mental goop that I wrote out about governance. Foster DAO call was helpful to get some motivation with the Notion & the wiki. Fueled my co-writing piece on Tuesday AM for metablogging.  Operand/Quartz update. Went for a walk. 

Tuesday Aug. 30: Read ethics book. Wrote intro to co-writing piece. Went for a walk and got flowers for osman. 

Wednesday Aug. 31 - Lease convo on phone with Cheri. Then, DeFi reading & Obsidian. Then, yoga. Lunch. Severance & nap. Now, writing a little bit about DeFi again. 

Thursday 9.1 - Browsed DAOHaus Discord for interesting things. Found OpEd about Web3 haters. Published post to Mirror about dangerous DeFi. I got zero hits. 

Friday 9.2 - Thinking about growth marketing to grow my newsletter. IndieHackers could have good content. Reddit privacy/defi groups?
