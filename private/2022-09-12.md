Wow. I'm in Atlanta. Doing it. New me, new chapter. Without Harry the turd. I am receiving a lot of compliments and I feel that people are into my vibes, like they're giving me customer service vibes and my mover who told me 'with all due respect, you are gorgeous.'

I feel surprised that I have not been writing as much these last several weeks. My velocity for the newsletter has gone down, but I did realize, I think, what my pivot is: I write mental flywheels. Closing loops is my jam. 

I need to find my peoples in Atlanta: writers, creatives, high IQs, worldly. I could, however, be stereotyping, but no..I feel like people in Bay Area are better conversationalists. I can walk into a coffee shop or a store and have an "intellectual" conversation. 

Try to do that in Atlanta. Be open minded and let the city surprise me. Let the people surprise me. Also, I can bring a taste of myself, like the conversations that I learned to have...I'm not very good at those. I'm better at being more of myself though, but I do have a judgement veil that comes up. 

Going on Twitter is like entering the public square. Even at a conference, it's a lot. I have to know which groups of people to talk to. I don't want to just bouncy bouncy bounce from one group to the next. Curation is a skill. 

Opportunity is super important. 

I don't wanna do work. I came out here to do work but no no no....curate Twitter. That's work.
