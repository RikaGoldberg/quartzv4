I have written about wstETH, rETH, and cbETH, so I'll probably focus on these. \n\nStrategy 1: Hold the LSTs and don't do anything with them. Earn yield on the LST.\n\nStrategy 2: Use the LST as collateral to gain leverage and borrow a stablecoin such as USDC. Continue to earn yield on the LST & now you also have USDC. Can use that USDC let's say to pay Opolis. Eventually will need to pay back USDC. Can repay loan using the position you used USDC for (not Opolis, that would be like taking out credit card debt). The position needs to make a profit so you can pay back USDC. \n\n\n","x":-380,"y":-280,"width":660,"height":360},
